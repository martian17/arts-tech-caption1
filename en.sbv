0:00:00.000,0:00:02.499
Of the use of artificial intelligence

0:00:02.499,0:00:05.009
in our societies

0:00:05.009,0:00:07.475
So today

0:00:07.475,0:00:12.571
Let's go back to today's discussion and workshop

0:00:12.571,0:00:15.950
I'm very much looking forward to do it of course

0:00:15.950,0:00:22.545
And I would like now maybe to give the flow to Jean-Yves Iatrides to say a few words

0:00:22.545,0:00:28.054
On the side of Air Liquide before moving to the representatives of Japanese embassy

0:00:28.054,0:00:30.000
Jean-Yves, the floor is yours

0:00:30.000,0:00:33.696
Thank you Sebastian, I hope you can hear me

0:00:33.696,0:00:36.894
Good morning, good afternoon, konnichiwa to all of you

0:00:36.894,0:00:42.931
So I'm Jean-Yves Iatrides, so I'm located in Japan

0:00:42.931,0:00:49.426
And I'm, in charge of the R&D activity for the Air Liquide Group for the Asia region

0:00:49.426,0:00:59.522
Thorough that as Sebastian said, it could look a bit strange to see Air Liquide as being part of this event

0:00:59.522,0:01:07.257
In fact, first of all, what is Air Liquide for the ones which don't know Air Liquide, or our colleagues in Japan maybe

0:01:07.257,0:01:10.739
Air Liquide is a company supplying industrial gases

0:01:10.739,0:01:15.396
In fact, we have been in Japan for more than 100 years

0:01:15.396,0:01:17.441
So we're not a newcomer in Japan

0:01:17.441,0:01:22.630
And of course being part of this exchange program with France and Japan

0:01:22.630,0:01:25.327
Is, I would say of use for us

0:01:25.327,0:01:27.806
And that's one reason

0:01:27.806,0:01:30.190
The second reason is that some hard innovation

0:01:30.190,0:01:37.058
As we know the heart of the company, and the company has been created a long time ago by an inventor

0:01:37.058,0:01:39.155
Which has been exploring in many fields

0:01:39.155,0:01:45.185
And I'm sure at least in some point of his career he's been catching the art also

0:01:45.185,0:01:50.710
And now what is very much the focus of the group

0:01:50.710,0:01:53.067
Is of course we need to transition

0:01:53.067,0:01:56.421
With the development of the hydrogen society

0:01:56.421,0:02:00.976
But also looking at any technology

0:02:00.976,0:02:04.979
that will allow us to develop a system that build future

0:02:04.979,0:02:09.671
And this question of AI is definitely one of the topics

0:02:09.671,0:02:12.861
that is very important in out minds

0:02:12.861,0:02:17.772
So the topic of the day is definitively

0:02:17.772,0:02:24.828
not directly linked between AI and the, we say unusual operation that we have in the company

0:02:24.828,0:02:28.754
But we have a feeling that such technology

0:02:28.754,0:02:30.953
or such new technology I would say,

0:02:30.953,0:02:32.507
which is really disruptive

0:02:32.507,0:02:41.759
Addressing, certainly the way we feel, we touch, (and) we get in contact with the things

0:02:41.759,0:02:47.601
cannot be only looked at from a short point view, or from a technical (or from) an engineer

0:02:47.601,0:02:51.272
I'm a very bad artist I'm an engineer

0:02:51.272,0:02:55.623
you know, dealing with numbers, dealing with mechanics, dealing with these kinds of things

0:02:55.623,0:03:03.831
But I'm still convinced that when we touch technology, and new technology especially, in the digital world

0:03:03.831,0:03:06.455
we have to look at it from a different angle

0:03:06.455,0:03:12.103
And this is one of the reasons we have been funding this and this year's program

0:03:12.103,0:03:16.501
at the Fondation France-Japon since the beginning of the creation

0:03:16.501,0:03:23.783
was to be about to approach topics from a more human science point of view

0:03:23.783,0:03:28.664
And honestly (that's uh) I think it's very interesting

0:03:28.664,0:03:30.811
it's complementary to what we do

0:03:30.811,0:03:34.586
And therefore I'm very delighted to be part of you today,

0:03:34.586,0:03:37.787
To listen I would be mostly listening

0:03:37.787,0:03:43.764
But again I had the opportunity to meet Eto-san in Paris

0:03:43.764,0:03:46.026
a few months ago when I was visiting Paris

0:03:46.026,0:03:51.578
And it was really interesting and I think we had a very nice discussion at our research center in Paris

0:03:51.578,0:03:56.057
And I think I'm looking forward for the presentation of today

0:03:56.057,0:03:57.977
Thank you very much for the invitation

0:03:57.977,0:04:01.374
Thank you, thank you very much Jean-Yves for your kind words

0:04:01.374,0:04:09.595
So now I would like to, before (the) what you are waiting for and you expected before the talk by Eto-san

0:04:09.595,0:04:16.030
I would like to give the floor to Mr. Takenouchi from Japanese embassy in Paris

0:04:16.030,0:04:21.325
to say a few words in the name of the Japanese authorities

0:04:21.325,0:04:26.287
Thank you for the kind introduction, My name is Yosuke Takenouchi

0:04:26.287,0:04:31.880
In charge of science and technology policies at the Embassy of Japan in France

0:04:31.880,0:04:35.132
And first of all, on behalf of the embassy,

0:04:35.132,0:04:40.660
I would like to congratulate you on the successful organization of today's workshop

0:04:40.660,0:04:45.903
As Covid continues to impose restrictions around the world

0:04:45.903,0:04:53.027
Science and technology-related events like this are still not as active as before

0:04:53.027,0:05:00.825
And under such circumstances I'm such delighted that today's event has come to be held

0:05:00.825,0:05:05.037
And I guess it was not an easy task to prepare

0:05:05.037,0:05:12.309
So I would express my sincere gratitude especially to Doctor Koichiro Eto

0:05:12.309,0:05:14.309
and Fondation France-Japon

0:05:14.309,0:05:19.396
and Air Liquide, and all the members involved for their efforts

0:05:19.396,0:05:25.023
And looking at the science and technology policies of both countries

0:05:25.023,0:05:29.864
In France, a research planning law has been enacted

0:05:29.864,0:05:35.849
That sets out the ten year research strategy starting in 2021

0:05:35.849,0:05:43.226
And similarly Japan has just formulated the science technology and innovation basic plan

0:05:43.226,0:05:49.505
which will run for five years starting in 2021 as well

0:05:49.505,0:05:59.588
And the main pillars for both plans are social transformation and strengthening of research capabilities

0:05:59.588,0:06:03.102
And education and human resources development

0:06:03.102,0:06:07.302
And I see there are so many similarities

0:06:07.302,0:06:11.557
In the challenges that Japan and France are facing

0:06:11.557,0:06:15.996
And needless to say among the social transformation

0:06:15.996,0:06:19.175
Brought about by advanced technologies

0:06:19.175,0:06:22.995
The impact of AI is enormous

0:06:22.995,0:06:27.610
And this is evident from reading the AI strategies

0:06:27.610,0:06:30.067
established in both countries

0:06:30.067,0:06:39.838
And discussing how we can make rapid social transformation more acceptable to society

0:06:39.838,0:06:46.198
is as important matters as technological development itself

0:06:46.198,0:06:52.148
So I understand that the theme of today's workshop is

0:06:52.148,0:06:57.844
to pursue the role of art as a solution to this question

0:06:57.844,0:07:01.697
which is a very interesting point of view

0:07:01.697,0:07:07.682
And I look forward to the presentation and the discussion of the participants today

0:07:07.682,0:07:12.191
And finally I would like to conclude my greetings

0:07:12.191,0:07:17.503
with a wish that today's workshop will be an opportunity

0:07:17.503,0:07:22.321
for our new collaborations across research fields and borders

0:07:22.321,0:07:23.561
Thank you very much

0:07:23.561,0:07:29.441
Thank you very much for your kind words Mr Takenouchi

0:07:29.441,0:07:36.402
And now it's time to give the flow to our colleague and friend Eto-san

0:07:36.402,0:07:44.048
so we hope you will enjoy this workshop

0:07:44.048,0:07:46.324
and enjoy the discussion as well

0:07:46.324,0:07:49.517
so the floor is yours, Ito-san, (in Japanese) douzo

0:07:49.517,0:07:54.031
Oh thank you very much. My name is Kouichiro Eto

0:07:54.031,0:07:58.866
And first, I would like to say thank you to all participants

0:07:58.866,0:08:01.785
Especially both speakers and audience

0:08:01.785,0:08:08.046
So I would like to start my presentation without further moment

0:08:08.046,0:08:17.128
Okay, I would like to start my presentation

0:08:17.128,0:08:24.860
My title of the presentation is "Art brings the future to our society"

0:08:24.860,0:08:31.648
And I am a 2021 FFJ/Air Liquide Fellow at Fondation France-Japon

0:08:31.648,0:08:34.802
And also I am a researcher at AIST

0:08:34.802,0:08:44.367
First of all, I would like to thank everyone who helped me make this workshop possible

0:08:44.367,0:08:48.194
First I would like to thank Mr, Jean-Yves Iatrides

0:08:48.194,0:08:50.260
from Air-Liquid corporation

0:08:50.260,0:08:54.886
and professor Sebastien Lechevalier from Fondation France-Japon

0:08:54.886,0:08:57.820
who made this fellowship possible

0:08:57.820,0:08:59.467
Thank you very much!

0:08:59.467,0:09:04.057
And I would like also to thank to my colleagues at FFJ

0:09:04.057,0:09:08.971
Fabien-san and Itoh-san, Jodie-san, and my colleague in Japan

0:09:08.971,0:09:10.971
Thank you for all

0:09:10.971,0:09:15.899
Before getting into the main topic

0:09:15.899,0:09:19.167
Let me explain the differences from the original plan

0:09:19.167,0:09:25.067
The initial plan was to investigate the cognitive differences in AI between Japan and the West,

0:09:25.067,0:09:30.275
However, it turned out to be difficult due to the reasons shown here

0:09:30.275,0:09:33.973
Therefore I have shifted the plan

0:09:33.973,0:09:37.028
I have defined the final objective

0:09:37.028,0:09:43.969
to investigate the relationship between AI and advanced technology in Europe

0:09:43.969,0:09:46.163
I appreciate your understandings

0:09:46.163,0:09:50.997
First, let me introduce myself

0:09:50.997,0:09:54.276
I have been working as an artist since the 90s

0:09:54.276,0:09:59.989
Then in 2002, I joined AIST and started working as a researcher

0:09:59.989,0:10:04.485
I would like to introduce two of my works

0:10:04.485,0:10:09.978
they are in common that they are works that they make the internet visible

0:10:09.978,0:10:17.000
This work is "Web Hopper"

0:10:17.000,0:10:19.619
You can see a world map on the screen

0:10:19.619,0:10:23.876
On this map you can see the user's web hopping trajectory

0:10:23.876,0:10:29.212
For example, let's say you are looking at a website in the US

0:10:29.212,0:10:32.457
Then you click a link to a Europe one

0:10:32.457,0:10:37.094
Then virtually you have jumped from the US to Europe

0:10:37.094,0:10:41.388
By analyzing internet traffic in real time

0:10:41.388,0:10:45.450
I could visualize the trajectory of web browsing

0:10:45.450,0:10:49.711
we published this work in 1996

0:10:49.711,0:10:53.017
we won the grand prix of Prix Ars Electronica

0:10:53.017,0:10:58.868
At that time, the work became a permanent exhibit

0:10:58.868,0:11:00.425
At the arts Ars Electronica center

0:11:00.425,0:11:05.395
We won the grand prix of Press Electronica

0:11:05.395,0:11:09.439
the press prize is the most prestigious award in this field

0:11:09.439,0:11:15.310
this exhibit is a hands-on model of the internet

0:11:15.310,0:11:19.176
This work shows how internet works

0:11:19.176,0:11:22.623
You can see a white table in front of you

0:11:22.623,0:11:24.737
And this is a terminal

0:11:24.737,0:11:29.371
Here you can make a packet with black and white balls

0:11:29.371,0:11:32.009
the first 8 balls are for an address

0:11:32.009,0:11:35.046
and the last eight balls are for data

0:11:35.046,0:11:39.270
You can only send one character at a time

0:11:39.270,0:11:42.570
Then press the "send" button

0:11:42.570,0:11:48.196
The packet goes through the internet

0:11:48.196,0:11:52.509
And the router moves the packet from the local area network to another network

0:11:52.509,0:11:55.794
So this is a routing table

0:11:55.794,0:12:03.040
And then a packet go from the (terminal) out to the internet

0:12:03.040,0:12:07.031
Then this is the destination terminal

0:12:07.031,0:12:10.680
The packet goes to the display of the terminal

0:12:10.680,0:12:19.051
Then the packet go into the display

0:12:19.051,0:12:25.918
You can see the content of the packet

0:12:25.918,0:12:28.012
which is a character "A"

0:12:28.012,0:12:32.485
We created this work in 2001

0:12:32.485,0:12:36.245
and you can still see it in the museum in Miraikan

0:12:36.245,0:12:40.242
If you have a chance to visit Tokyo

0:12:40.242,0:12:42.493
please drop by Miraikan!

0:12:42.493,0:12:49.781
What I would like to explain here is a period in the 90s

0:12:49.781,0:12:53.257
This age was a very early stage of the internet

0:12:53.257,0:12:56.775
At that time, the internet was an advanced technology

0:12:56.775,0:13:01.305
These works explain how the internet works

0:13:01.305,0:13:03.272
for the general public

0:13:03.272,0:13:09.533
Since 2002, I have been a researcher at AIST

0:13:09.533,0:13:15.298
continuing a research theme, how we can design a press for co-creation

0:13:15.298,0:13:23.259
The key concept of my research is that the users should design the system

0:13:23.259,0:13:27.598
This picture is of a famous architect Christopher Alexander

0:13:27.598,0:13:32.086
He said that the users should design the architecture

0:13:32.086,0:13:36.470
If we do that, we won't need architects anymore

0:13:36.470,0:13:41.023
Instead, he created a pattern language

0:13:41.023,0:13:43.309
to make this concept possible

0:13:43.309,0:13:46.413
a method to design architecture without architects

0:13:46.413,0:13:50.195
this idea is a key concept of my research

0:13:50.195,0:13:55.375
We created several co-creation platforms

0:13:55.375,0:13:58.685
that connects various fields based on this concept

0:13:58.685,0:14:03.025
The most significant achievement was the Niconico-Gakkai beta

0:14:03.025,0:14:09.218
We created a platform that connects the general public with professional researchers

0:14:09.218,0:14:14.642
Even if they are not working as professional researchers

0:14:14.642,0:14:16.959
there are still people doing research

0:14:16.959,0:14:19.964
We call them "Wild Researchers"

0:14:19.964,0:14:25.093
And we created a press for them to present their research with us

0:14:25.093,0:14:30.976
We started this project in 2011, and held 9 large scale symposiums

0:14:30.976,0:14:37.170
The first symposium attracted 110,000 audience on the internet

0:14:37.170,0:14:42.754
The total number of viewers was over 658,000 (615,000?) people

0:14:42.754,0:14:47.905
Since then I have expanded my activities as follows

0:14:47.905,0:14:55.327
I would like to share the latest research result of our research

0:14:55.327,0:15:01.031
In January of this year, we published this paper to classify

0:15:01.031,0:15:05.436
74 facial emojis on the valence-arousal axes

0:15:05.436,0:15:08.464
Pleasantness and intensity

0:15:08.464,0:15:14.689
We published this paper in Scientific Reports, and it is press released from Nature Asia

0:15:14.689,0:15:23.908
And now I would like to start explaining this fellowship result

0:15:23.908,0:15:29.805
First, I set the research question as "What is the role of art in advanced technology?"

0:15:29.805,0:15:35.239
then I would like to move onto the background, method and findings

0:15:35.239,0:15:43.258
First, there are already some pioneering studies on the relationship between AI and art

0:15:43.258,0:15:50.706
First of all, there is a book "AI for creation" by professor Nao Tokui from Keio University

0:15:50.706,0:15:53.211
He is also a speaker at this workshop

0:15:53.211,0:15:56.475
His book is a very detailed description of

0:15:56.475,0:16:00.523
how can we use AI to develop human creativity

0:16:00.523,0:16:03.779
Also, professor Sofian Audry's book

0:16:03.779,0:16:05.851
"Art in the age of machine learning"

0:16:05.851,0:16:07.692
is published last year

0:16:07.692,0:16:12.229
Go back to the history of the computer art

0:16:12.229,0:16:14.916
This research is also excellent

0:16:14.916,0:16:24.520
Also the MDPI journal "Arts as a special institute" on "The Machine as Artist" in 2019

0:16:24.520,0:16:29.451
which includes 17 people's 17 papers

0:16:29.451,0:16:31.615
all of which are very worthwhile

0:16:31.615,0:16:38.787
And let's start with an explanation of observations in Europe

0:16:38.787,0:16:43.881
I visited various events and centers where arts and science are related

0:16:43.881,0:16:52.031
Ars Electronica is the most significant example in Europe

0:16:52.031,0:16:58.286
This center began as a Media Art Festival in 1979

0:16:58.286,0:17:00.833
the oldest and biggest in the world

0:17:00.833,0:17:05.840
They started Prix Ars Electronica in 1987

0:17:05.840,0:17:10.203
the award is the most highly regarded in the media-art field

0:17:10.203,0:17:17.751
In 1996, they opened the Ars Electronica center as shown in this picture

0:17:17.751,0:17:20.994
And they also started an R&D center

0:17:20.994,0:17:23.816
called "Future Lab" in the same building

0:17:23.816,0:17:28.483
But my relationship with Ars Electronica is strong

0:17:28.483,0:17:32.173
I recieved the Prix Ars Electronica three times

0:17:32.173,0:17:34.811
Including the Grand Prix of 1997

0:17:34.811,0:17:42.938
From my point of view, the most significant result of future lab is Spaxels

0:17:42.938,0:17:47.894
They started the project in 2012

0:17:47.894,0:17:52.317
to draw pictures in the sky using drones

0:17:52.317,0:17:55.372
They named this project "Spaxels"

0:17:55.372,0:17:58.296
The meaning is "pixels in space"

0:17:58.296,0:18:03.398
I saw the initial launch event at Linz in 2012

0:18:03.398,0:18:10.618
In honest, I felt that the light was so weak and unreliable at that time

0:18:10.618,0:18:13.670
But this project grew steadily

0:18:13.670,0:18:18.474
In 2015, they started a joint research with Intel

0:18:18.474,0:18:21.388
And they developed this project far away

0:18:21.388,0:18:28.436
In 2021, Intel drew a symbol mark of Tokyo 2020

0:18:28.436,0:18:31.270
At the opening ceremony of Tokyo (Olympics)

0:18:31.270,0:18:39.515
And they held the Ars Electronica festival in 2021 again

0:18:39.515,0:18:41.820
but it was a hybrid event

0:18:41.820,0:18:47.051
Usually the festival attracts so many artists from all over the world

0:18:47.051,0:18:51.889
But this year, there was almost no artists from overseas

0:18:51.889,0:18:53.961
It was a quiet event

0:18:53.961,0:18:59.908
But I found an excellent exhibit

0:18:59.908,0:19:06.090
Future Lab also produces exhibits for the Ars Electronica Center

0:19:06.090,0:19:11.328
In this video you can see 11 monitors in front of you

0:19:11.328,0:19:16.303
In these monitors you can see the hidden layers of DNN

0:19:16.303,0:19:21.096
As you know, there are many layers behind the deep neural network

0:19:21.096,0:19:25.986
And this exhibit shows the mechanism of the DNN very well

0:19:25.986,0:19:33.589
In detail, they use the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with the VGG16 network

0:19:33.589,0:19:37.663
I think this is a simple idea but effective

0:19:37.663,0:19:43.521
By showing the layers all at once, we can see how the DNN works

0:19:43.521,0:19:52.523
I had a chance to interview Hideaki Ogawa, the co-director of the Future Lab

0:19:52.523,0:19:55.696
I was impressed by his words,

0:19:55.696,0:19:59.230
Just as water comes out when you twist the tap

0:19:59.230,0:20:04.022
The future comes out when you type "twist the tap" at the Ars Electronica Center

0:20:04.022,0:20:09.216
He is also an artist still creating their artworks

0:20:09.216,0:20:17.751
Events like this Ars Electronica are now taking place in other cities

0:20:17.751,0:20:24.036
In Paris, there is a similar event called the Némo Biennale

0:20:24.036,0:20:30.462
They held the event at Centquatre and various other locations in Paris

0:20:30.462,0:20:35.026
They designed this event to connect science and art

0:20:35.026,0:20:43.612
I participated in this event and I felt that the direction was so close to the Ars Electronica Festival

0:20:43.612,0:20:49.538
And there are events called Maker Faire

0:20:49.538,0:20:54.205
where people who like to make things gather and show their creations

0:20:54.205,0:21:00.806
The maker faire events are all over the world, and the Nantes Maker Campus was outstanding quality

0:21:00.806,0:21:07.675
And also, I am a director of Tsukuba Mini Maker faire

0:21:07.675,0:21:14.462
Then I met several artists and interviewed them

0:21:14.462,0:21:20.042
First let me introduce "La Machine"

0:21:20.042,0:21:22.793
The moving giant elephant of Nantes

0:21:22.793,0:21:30.000
In the city of Nantes, big elephant carried a lot of people around the city everyday

0:21:30.000,0:21:35.925
And I had a chance to interview the artistic director Mr. Francois Delaroziere

0:21:35.925,0:21:44.080
And according to him, it is important to have such huge artwork moving around the public open city and open space

0:21:44.080,0:21:48.897
And I felt that this is loved by the citizens very much

0:21:48.897,0:21:56.193
From Francois Delaroziere

0:21:56.193,0:22:00.714
I was particularly interested in his focus on movement

0:22:00.714,0:22:08.907
And according to him, movement is a language (of) a machine, and a mechanical organisms

0:22:08.907,0:22:14.380
The next artist is Scott Eaton

0:22:14.380,0:22:17.408
The picture on the left is a finished painting

0:22:17.408,0:22:23.056
The video on the right side shows how he is drawing it

0:22:23.056,0:22:28.550
As you can see, it is just a simple sketch with an outline

0:22:28.550,0:22:33.576
But the AI automatically drew the content with human body

0:22:33.576,0:22:37.505
Scott Eaton has a background in art

0:22:37.505,0:22:41.292
and he also graduated from the MIT media lab

0:22:41.292,0:22:43.964
so he is very good at computer science

0:22:43.964,0:22:50.325
And he studied drawing and sculpture in Florence in Italy

0:22:50.325,0:22:55.229
I think his paintings are under the influence of Michelangelo

0:22:55.229,0:23:02.934
I had the opportunity to interview him, and it was fascinating

0:23:02.934,0:23:08.688
I think he has a great philosophy as an artist who uses AI

0:23:08.688,0:23:12.245
In particular I would like to emphasize the word

0:23:12.245,0:23:15.740
"For an artist, failure is sometimes beautiful"

0:23:15.740,0:23:20.566
I think this is a natural appeal of media art

0:23:20.566,0:23:24.231
Creating art through repeated experimentations

0:23:24.231,0:23:29.416
Next up is Fernado Magalhães

0:23:29.416,0:23:34.229
As you can see, he created a computer graphics image

0:23:34.229,0:23:36.677
that looks like Japanese superheroes

0:23:36.677,0:23:41.029
He didn't make these images by hand

0:23:41.029,0:23:44.655
But he designed an algorithm to create superheroes

0:23:44.655,0:23:52.793
Based on that algorithm the program generates countless superhero's shapes automatically

0:23:52.793,0:23:57.688
This kind of art is what we call "Generative Art"

0:23:57.688,0:24:01.596
I interviewed him also

0:24:01.596,0:24:04.654
He was born in São Paulo Brazil

0:24:04.654,0:24:07.830
and watched Japanese TV programs in childhood

0:24:07.830,0:24:13.010
So it was there that he came in contact with Japanese culture

0:24:13.010,0:24:15.793
and begin to create these kinds of works

0:24:15.793,0:24:24.576
So I would like to explain what I have learned from these experiences

0:24:24.576,0:24:31.982
First of all I would like to say that I have (never) been to more places

0:24:31.982,0:24:36.618
One that most impressed me was Grotte Chauvet

0:24:36.618,0:24:46.240
This Grotte Chauvet is a cave mural that exists about 36 thousand years old

0:24:46.240,0:24:52.613
Lascaux cave is 20 thousand years old

0:24:52.613,0:24:55.962
So this is probably the oldest cave mural

0:24:55.962,0:25:02.484
We see here a replica of Grotte Chauvet called Grotte Chauvet 2

0:25:02.484,0:25:06.227
Although it is a replica it is so realistic

0:25:06.227,0:25:09.764
It looks like (the) real thing is here

0:25:09.764,0:25:15.061
Here is a mural of lions, but it exists within the same reality

0:25:15.061,0:25:17.605
I was very impressed by this

0:25:17.605,0:25:28.150
And before I came to France, I thought that this "Europe" was a place where the modern western culture has developed

0:25:28.150,0:25:30.312
But that was not the case

0:25:30.312,0:25:36.975
I mean the coast of Mediterranean sea is where civilization begun

0:25:36.975,0:25:40.385
I was finally able to understand this

0:25:40.385,0:25:48.363
Then what force drives the progress of civilization?

0:25:48.363,0:25:55.170
The science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson invented the term "Metaverse"

0:25:55.170,0:25:57.523
in his novel Snow Crash

0:25:57.523,0:26:03.884
In this book, he says that there are some layers of languages

0:26:03.884,0:26:09.500
And the civilization progress is through the power of crossing between these layers

0:26:09.500,0:26:16.155
In his word, "Code" or programming language, is a latest language layer

0:26:16.155,0:26:21.504
A language defines our thinking

0:26:21.504,0:26:27.716
It is difficult to share a concept that has not yet been put into words

0:26:27.716,0:26:30.164
Please imagine this:

0:26:30.164,0:26:37.500
How would you tell yourself in 2019 what was the changes brought by Covid-19

0:26:37.500,0:26:43.422
I think you will find it a bit difficult

0:26:43.422,0:26:49.311
Once a common language is established, sharing concepts becomes possible

0:26:49.311,0:26:57.921
And the role of human in a society is dictated by the measure of technological changes

0:26:57.921,0:27:02.810
The industrial revolution was governed by natural laws

0:27:02.810,0:27:07.410
In particular, how to control engines was very important

0:27:07.410,0:27:14.711
Locomotive automobiles, looms, and letter presses are all powered by engines

0:27:14.711,0:27:21.503
Please remember that the term "engineering" comes from engine

0:27:21.503,0:27:27.897
On the other hand, the IT revolution is governed by language

0:27:27.897,0:27:35.757
So when we can express it in a language, we can execute it

0:27:35.757,0:27:40.739
For example, we often compare a hacker to a wizard

0:27:40.739,0:27:45.292
When a wizard casts a spell, it becomes true

0:27:45.292,0:27:50.532
In this situation, "the spell" means a programming language

0:27:50.532,0:27:59.040
And next, let's consider the AI revolution that is taking place

0:27:59.040,0:28:03.694
I believe that AI is governed by imagination

0:28:03.694,0:28:08.678
In AI, everything exists in a probabilistic way

0:28:08.678,0:28:13.702
There is not rigid distinction between 0 or 1

0:28:13.702,0:28:20.032
From my point of view, this is closer to painting than language

0:28:20.032,0:28:26.373
I mean, In other words, what can be visualized can be executed

0:28:26.373,0:28:37.743
I remind Scott Eaton's statement that "The artist controls the AI with his imagination and ideas" is a perfect example of this

0:28:37.743,0:28:41.753
So I would like to return to the research question

0:28:41.753,0:28:44.783
What is the role of art in advanced technology

0:28:44.783,0:28:49.122
My findings are to be a source of imaginations

0:28:49.122,0:28:53.938
and expands the possibilities to advance the technology

0:28:53.938,0:28:58.008
So I would like to end my presentation

0:28:58.008,0:28:59.934
And thank you very much

0:29:09.297,0:29:12.888
Then

0:29:12.888,0:29:17.862
Can I go progress?

0:29:17.862,0:29:24.625
Yes please, I will give you the floor to organize the round table thank you very much!

0:29:24.625,0:29:26.068
There will be

0:29:26.068,0:29:27.867
I think there will be many questions

0:29:27.867,0:29:31.503
And congratulations of course though on your talk

0:29:31.503,0:29:38.249
But I think in order to have a good discussion it's good to move to the round table

0:29:38.249,0:29:41.801
and then to have the discussion

0:29:41.801,0:29:43.942
Okay thank you very much

0:29:43.942,0:29:47.880
Then let's start the session one

0:29:47.880,0:29:53.400
So in session one we have a presentation from *Attos* first

0:29:53.400,0:29:58.200
Then we will have a presentation from Nao Tokui from Keio University

0:29:58.200,0:30:02.765
Tokui-sensei, could you please start your presentation?

0:30:02.765,0:30:07.877
Hi, yes, thank you!

0:30:07.877,0:30:10.552
(in Japanese) Kikoemasuka? Do you hear me?

0:30:10.552,0:30:13.114
Uh yes, clearly!

0:30:13.114,0:30:14.370
Thank you very much

0:30:14.370,0:30:19.323
Okay so, hi everyone

0:30:19.323,0:30:21.673
Bonjour, thank you for having me

0:30:21.673,0:30:24.441
So let me start my presentation

0:30:24.441,0:30:27.972
So can I share my screen?

0:30:48.654,0:30:53.339
Normally, you can share, you have the right to share that

0:30:53.339,0:30:55.954
yes

0:30:55.954,0:30:58.045
Okay, thanks!

0:30:58.045,0:31:02.122
So today I will talk about AI and creativity

0:31:02.122,0:31:05.471
And before that let me introduce myself

0:31:05.471,0:31:07.530
So my name is Nao Tokui

0:31:07.530,0:31:10.525
I'm an artist and researcher

0:31:10.525,0:31:19.650
And also I'm a founder and CEO of Tokyo based art collective Qosmo

0:31:19.650,0:31:24.470
And I also organized

0:31:24.470,0:31:31.095
computational creativity laboratory at Keio University in Japan

0:31:31.095,0:31:35.509
So today, I want to talk about

0:31:35.509,0:31:37.208
AI and creativity

0:31:37.208,0:31:41.806
And Especially the main theme of my talk is this:

0:31:41.806,0:31:46.187
Is AI capable of creating something new and original?

0:31:46.187,0:31:55.732
Maybe more precisely: Is AI capable of helping us create something new and original

0:31:55.732,0:32:00.751
rather than imitating what we humans have already created

0:32:00.751,0:32:07.613
So why I got interested in this topic

0:32:07.613,0:32:10.402
Is this,

0:32:10.402,0:32:15.548
I entered the University of Tokyo in 1995

0:32:15.548,0:32:22.972
And joined the laboratory, I mean the AI laboratory in 1998

0:32:22.972,0:32:28.322
And also at the same time, I started DJ'ing myself

0:32:28.322,0:32:32.969
And I got kind of obsessed with music

0:32:32.969,0:32:43.032
And I started thinking like "I want to create music, I want to create new music nobody ever listened to"

0:32:43.032,0:32:44.205
so

0:32:44.205,0:32:47.949
But I don't play any musical instruments

0:32:47.949,0:32:51.716
and I don't barely read musical scores

0:32:51.716,0:32:54.299
so how can I make interesting music

0:32:54.299,0:32:59.134
so naturally I turned to programming and AI

0:32:59.134,0:33:08.031
So here, I'm not interested in optimizing and streamlining the music making process

0:33:08.031,0:33:14.084
to make more hit songs more economically

0:33:14.084,0:33:19.385
Rather, instead, I'm interested in

0:33:19.385,0:33:23.718
diversification and deviation

0:33:23.718,0:33:30.359
so how can I make something unique music, 

0:33:30.359,0:33:37.694
you know basically a new music

0:33:37.694,0:33:44.973
And here I have an agenda of my talk today

0:33:44.973,0:33:49.543
So I want to talk about three topics

0:33:49.543,0:33:55.257
And first one is "Misusable" AI tools

0:33:55.257,0:34:02.356
The importance of music tools you can misuse

0:34:02.356,0:34:15.300
And you may find it a little bit strange to use the word "misuse" in the discussion of AI

0:34:15.300,0:34:23.600
But when you look back the history of music and other creative fields

0:34:23.600,0:34:33.624
you may realize that it is in fact a history of misuse and misappropriated new technologies

0:34:33.624,0:34:46.898
So one of the recurring patterns is when an artist use new technologies in a way the original inventor didn't intend or imagine

0:34:46.898,0:34:51.258
It is when new form of expression emerge

0:34:51.258,0:34:59.588
So the prime example of these misused technology is for example

0:34:59.588,0:35:03.861
turn table and samplers

0:35:03.861,0:35:11.133
So as for turn tables, you are not supposed to touch and move the vinyl record right?

0:35:11.133,0:35:21.394
And samplers were invented to imitate expensive physical instruments such as pianos and violins

0:35:21.394,0:35:30.397
But the inventor didn't expect users to appropriate and sample somebody else's records and musics

0:35:30.397,0:35:35.196
Such as Funky Drummers or Aiming Brakes or whatever

0:35:35.196,0:35:44.341
And when we think about the current status of AI music tools

0:35:44.341,0:35:47.235
or AI creative tools in general

0:35:47.235,0:35:55.900
You see both extreme ends of spectrum here

0:35:55.900,0:36:06.811
On one hand, you have programmer oriented tools

0:36:06.811,0:36:16.017
like, so you need to install Python and Tensor Flow and you need CUDA of course

0:36:16.017,0:36:24.367
And you know, you need to get used to these tools to make something unique or something new

0:36:24.367,0:36:34.364
And I'm sure some artists can learn and train themselves to get used to these tools

0:36:34.364,0:36:37.930
but usually it's not the case

0:36:37.930,0:36:43.855
And at the other end of the spectrum, we have

0:36:43.855,0:36:49.085
very well-packaged tools, AI tools

0:36:49.085,0:37:00.000
So with one click you can generate a music or with one click the AI can edit your photo, or images, you know

0:37:00.000,0:37:05.370
And in some cases, that's good

0:37:05.370,0:37:09.955
But I think if the tool is too well packaged

0:37:09.955,0:37:21.539
then you cannot "misuse" or you cannot use these tools in your own way, or in your own creative way

0:37:21.539,0:37:32.405
So I think we need something in between these two ends of the spectrum

0:37:32.405,0:37:36.823
And I call it "Misusable" AI tools

0:37:36.823,0:37:47.791
And following this principal, I created a simple AI tool for musicians

0:37:47.791,0:37:57.645
And it is on Ableton Live, a famous digital audio workstation software

0:37:57.645,0:38:06.847
And yeah, so this is an Ableton Live plugin

0:38:06.847,0:38:15.618
And what it does is it allows you as artist to train your own AI model

0:38:15.618,0:38:22.697
within this software, so you don't have to deal with Python and CUDA

0:38:22.697,0:38:30.658
So only thing you need to do is just collect music data, in this case MIDI files

0:38:30.658,0:38:33.875
and drag and drop on this device

0:38:33.875,0:38:47.169
And voila, you got a trained model on this device, and you can generate new rhythms continuously

0:38:47.169,0:38:49.770
And you can:

0:38:49.770,0:38:51.396
♫sick beats♫

0:38:51.396,0:38:53.472
I hope you can hear the audio

0:38:53.472,0:39:04.476
♫sick beats♫

0:39:04.476,0:39:09.927
And a good thing about this tool is that you can actually "misuse" this tool

0:39:09.927,0:39:15.209
So you can train your model with very obscure data sets

0:39:15.209,0:39:28.033
or, I don't know, this device is meant for rhythm generation, but you can train your own model with a melody data, for example

0:39:28.033,0:39:32.715
and see what comes out

0:39:32.715,0:39:39.737
Okay, that's one small project I did in 2020

0:39:39.737,0:39:45.598
And I want to talk about the second topic here

0:39:45.598,0:39:52.214
Which is embracing the uncertainty or errors AI brings

0:39:52.214,0:40:05.527
So this is a visualization of the output of the same model I just introduced

0:40:05.527,0:40:14.230
And this is useful and great, and also you can misuse this tools to generate something unique

0:40:14.230,0:40:18.632
But still you need your own training data to train this model

0:40:18.632,0:40:28.117
And mainly you can say like this model is still imitating human creation with AI, right?

0:40:28.117,0:40:36.470
So in 2017 I created something called "Neural Beatbox"

0:40:36.470,0:40:41.963
So what I did is to combine rhythm generation model, the same rhythm generation model,

0:40:41.963,0:40:45.481
with a sound classification model

0:40:45.481,0:40:55.992
And you can play this neural beatbox on this website neuralbeatbox.net

0:40:55.992,0:40:59.760
so if you're interested please take a look

0:40:59.760,0:41:09.080
what I did was to integrate the sound classification model with the rhythm generation model

0:41:09.080,0:41:16.180
And generated rhythm pattern will be played

0:41:16.180,0:41:20.946
with the instant drum kit

0:41:20.946,0:41:25.743
the sound classification model created out of the recorded sound materials

0:41:25.743,0:41:29.360
♫beatbox♫

0:41:29.360,0:41:36.033
So we created this website during the Covid lockdown

0:41:36.033,0:41:48.490
on this website you create your own beat with the help of AI and you can share your sessions with your friends

0:41:48.490,0:41:55.557
So that you can join your instant beatbox session

0:41:55.557,0:42:03.782
And I should mention that sound classification is not perfect of course

0:42:03.782,0:42:06.858
but that's what we wanted

0:42:06.858,0:42:17.283
We wanted to deviate from what humans have created

0:42:17.283,0:42:30.142
♫sick session♫

0:42:30.142,0:42:34.450
Okay ,so what I just said is like this

0:42:34.450,0:42:43.569
so when you try to create something new and unique you want to deviate and branch out from the conventions or common senses

0:42:43.569,0:42:49.134
And we hope it will be a manifestation of creativity, but sometimes,

0:42:49.134,0:43:03.739
Especially from a conventional perspective, these deviation can be just a mistake or an error, right?

0:43:03.739,0:43:10.157
So we need to know how to embrace the mistakes

0:43:10.157,0:43:27.073
And you have to know how to differentiate mistakes from, you know, a manifestation of creativity

0:43:27.073,0:43:41.723
And this error and creativity is one of my main theme I think

0:43:41.723,0:43:49.476
So the other project where I embrace the uncertainty of AI is this AI DJ project

0:43:49.476,0:43:54.277
It's a back-to-back DJ session with me

0:43:54.277,0:43:59.898
and AI DJ

0:43:59.898,0:44:09.995
and AI DJ selects and plays sometimes unexpected songs

0:44:09.995,0:44:14.678
But this uncertainty leads to very interesting DJ performance

0:44:14.678,0:44:28.573
So sometimes the AI selects something I didn't expect or I couldn't imagine

0:44:28.573,0:44:41.733
But this unexpectedness was so interesting as a DJ

0:44:41.733,0:44:54.507
And we are so fortunate to have opportunities to play at various locations including Google I/O in San Francisco

0:44:54.507,0:44:57.568
and Scopitone festival in Nantes

0:44:57.568,0:45:13.599
So we extended this scene and we turned it into a real-time AI jam session

0:45:13.599,0:45:24.801
♫sick jam session♫

0:45:24.801,0:45:34.878
I hope you can listen to and hear the audio now

0:45:34.878,0:45:38.587
(In Japanese) Daijoubukana?

0:45:38.587,0:45:47.051
Anyway, so instead of letting AI to select existing music

0:45:47.051,0:45:54.122
We made an AI system that makes music on stage in real time

0:45:54.122,0:45:59.361
So in this performance, three AI models, namely

0:45:59.361,0:46:08.455
rhythm generation model, baseline generation, and loop selection interact with each other

0:46:08.455,0:46:11.404
And keep improvising a dance track

0:46:11.404,0:46:19.898
So I as a DJ intervene the processor by manipulating mixer and adding a sound in the turn table

0:46:19.898,0:46:28.676
So it's not a disk jockey anymore, it's more like a machine jockey or an AI jockey

0:46:28.676,0:46:38.248
Okay, so finally I want to talk about this, pushing AI to the edge

0:46:38.248,0:46:45.788
And so let's get back to the original question: Is AI capable of creating something new and original

0:46:45.788,0:46:52.780
So here I want to talk about Generative Adversarial Network

0:46:52.780,0:46:58.212
So it's a famous framework so I'm not going to explain it in detail

0:46:58.212,0:47:07.626
But it's so famous for the capability of generating very realistic faces

0:47:07.626,0:47:12.994
But here, I want to use it for, again rhythm patterns

0:47:12.994,0:47:24.756
And in this model I added a conditioning input

0:47:24.756,0:47:32.428
so you can specify the genre, and generate patterns

0:47:32.428,0:47:41.770
*silence*

0:47:41.770,0:47:47.000
do you hear the audio? I cannot hear

0:47:47.000,0:47:49.715
Uh I cannot hear

0:47:49.715,0:47:51.647
somehow

0:47:51.647,0:47:53.789
Good? No?

0:47:53.789,0:47:55.619
No

0:47:55.619,0:48:18.696
*deafening silence*

0:48:18.696,0:48:24.863
Sorry, do it again

0:48:24.863,0:48:28.057
*drum plays for a second*

0:48:28.057,0:48:30.242
Okay

0:48:30.242,0:48:38.615
*silence*

0:48:38.615,0:48:49.815
So again, I added a conditional input so that you can specify the genre of the generated rhythm patterns

0:48:49.815,0:48:58.019
But it's not interesting, so I added another discriminator to this model

0:48:58.019,0:49:13.192
I added another discriminator that is for classifying the genre of the generated rhythms

0:49:13.192,0:49:20.935
So the generator is trained to confuse the additional discriminator as well

0:49:20.935,0:49:32.940
so that it can generate realistic rhythm patterns that don't belong to any genres in the training data set

0:49:32.940,0:49:37.060
So this is the result

0:49:37.060,0:49:42.523
*sick beat ensues*

0:49:42.523,0:49:47.547
I hope you can hear, I don't I can hear (Yes we can, and it's awesome!)

0:49:47.547,0:49:50.350
(In Japanese) Daijoobudesuka?

0:49:50.350,0:50:07.742
*sick hit-hat beats*

0:50:07.742,0:50:19.989
So here, I wanted to realize the tag of war between conventions and deviations

0:50:19.989,0:50:30.084
So now AI is trying to tell which deviation is good and interesting

0:50:30.084,0:50:36.498
And this is I believe what human artists do actually

0:50:36.498,0:50:44.334
And finally I want to introduce one of my favorite quotes of Scott Adams

0:50:44.334,0:50:52.060
He's a famous comic writer of Dilbert comic strip

0:50:52.060,0:51:00.000
And it goes like this: Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep

0:51:00.000,0:51:10.937
And in the context of AI and creativity I think AI is a tool that helps you make interesting, meaningful, and amusing mistakes

0:51:10.937,0:51:17.239
And consequently, it helps you to create something new and original

0:51:17.239,0:51:26.457
Okay, finally as Eto-san introduced, I published this book last year

0:51:26.457,0:51:36.966
And I'm working on English translation, and hopefully I can deliver it within a few months

0:51:36.966,0:51:42.124
Okay, so thank you so much!

0:51:42.124,0:51:49.503
Thank you very much Tokui-sensei, I loved the presentation very much

0:51:49.503,0:51:51.458
I'm sorry about the audio trouble

0:51:51.458,0:51:57.883
No no, no problem, I have so much questions for Professor Tokui

0:51:57.883,0:52:06.521
But on this program, I will do the presentation for session one and all

0:52:06.521,0:52:10.099
Then we'll have a 10 minutes Q and A

0:52:10.099,0:52:14.944
So I would like to do this and to next presenter

0:52:15.000,0:52:22.396
So next presenter from IRCAM Professor Gerard Assayag

0:52:22.396,0:52:26.440
Assayag-sensei, can you hear me?

0:52:26.440,0:52:27.351
Yes, yes.

0:52:27.351,0:52:35.361
Okay, thank you very much for accepting the offer to be a speaker of this lecture.

0:52:35.361,0:52:39.340
Could you please start your presentation as I can say?

0:52:39.340,0:52:39.840
Okay.

0:52:43.520,0:52:45.840
Here you are.

0:52:48.160,0:52:49.053
Can you see it?

0:52:49.053,0:52:49.765
Yes.

0:52:49.765,0:52:52.878
Perfect all right so,

0:52:52.878,0:53:01.922
My presentation will be about my ERC European Research Council advanced grant REACH:

0:53:01.922,0:53:07.276
Raising co-creativity in Cyber-Human Musicianship

0:53:07.276,0:53:09.846
First of all let me present IRCAM,

0:53:09.846,0:53:12.097
the place where I am a researcher

0:53:12.097,0:53:15.718
So IRCAM is the institute where we research the coordination of acoustic music,

0:53:15.718,0:53:18.812
which is actually a part of Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.

0:53:18.812,0:53:26.603
It was created by famous conductor and composer Pierre Boulez in the 70s when the when the Centre Pompidou was created.

0:53:26.603,0:53:32.866
And it is the the music and sound research parts of Centre Pompidou.

0:53:32.866,0:53:38.518
So we have a three part in IRCAM,

0:53:38.518,0:53:42.394
a research lab called Science and Technology of Sound and Music (STMS),

0:53:42.394,0:53:50.320
who is operated by CNRS and Sorbonne University and IRCAM of course, and the Minister of the Culture Communication.

0:53:50.320,0:53:52.960
We have a music creation department

0:53:54.000,0:53:58.967
with concert halls and composers in residence.

0:53:58.967,0:54:01.111
And music commissions etc. 

0:54:01.111,0:54:06.853
And we have an education department where we have a master's program 
first for young scientists,

0:54:06.853,0:54:11.103
and another program in technology for musicians.

0:54:11.103,0:54:14.480
So it's a very original model of innovation and creativity

0:54:15.280,0:54:21.040
where we have artists that are immersed into a research context.

0:54:23.360,0:54:30.033
All right, so in IRCAM I have created a team called Music Representation team years ago,

0:54:30.033,0:54:34.937
and now it has become the biggest team in IRCAM.

0:54:34.937,0:54:41.157
And we have a lot of researchers on AI and creativity for artistic purposes

0:54:41.157,0:54:42.182
specifically music.

0:54:42.182,0:54:45.376
So we have five poles in this team,

0:54:45.376,0:54:48.926
so certain of these poles are concerned with

0:54:48.926,0:54:54.992
music, composition formalization, and formal approaches to music.

0:54:54.992,0:55:00.210
But we have the three poles here are really concerned with artificial intelligence.

0:55:00.210,0:55:04.709
So REACH is really the project that I will be speaking about.

0:55:04.709,0:55:14.009
ACIDS is a project that is highly oriented towards the machine learning for creative applications.

0:55:14.009,0:55:21.760
And activities is really oriented towards the idea of time, and how you write and control the time in an interactive setup.

0:55:23.840,0:55:30.320
So to give an example, here is a program that I wrote many years ago,

0:55:31.040,0:55:37.007
and has now become the standard all over the world for a computer-assisted composition.

0:55:37.007,0:55:38.504
It's called open music,

0:55:38.504,0:55:40.436
and we have published three books where

0:55:40.436,0:55:46.803
thousands of composers explain how they would use open music to create new music.

0:55:46.803,0:55:51.378
So open music is actually a programming language but it is a visual programming language.

0:55:51.378,0:55:59.555
So composers learn how to program more easily because it's totally visual and they can design new musical application.

0:55:59.555,0:56:03.400
So this is not the artificial intelligence approach, this is the formal approaches,

0:56:03.400,0:56:10.708
where composers actually have to specify the algorithm that they want to use in order to create music.

0:56:10.708,0:56:14.320
After having created open music with of course with my team,

0:56:15.280,0:56:20.160
I have moved to the idea of creating intelligent interaction with agents.

0:56:20.160,0:56:24.638
With creative agents so we are moving closer to artificial intelligence.

0:56:24.638,0:56:29.145
And again quite a number of years ago, I created with colleagues

0:56:29.145,0:56:32.893
the OMax paradigm of intelligent interaction.

0:56:32.893,0:56:38.049
So you see OMax is really the simple idea that you have intelligent agent

0:56:38.049,0:56:44.576
feed with AI that are able to listen to music either in offline or in real time,

0:56:44.576,0:56:47.420
that are able simultaneously to learn.

0:56:47.420,0:56:52.213
So apply a machine learning model create a model, so a mirror of musical memory,

0:56:52.213,0:56:59.751
simultaneously scan and navigate the memory in order to generate new materials

0:56:59.751,0:57:02.734
and propose this new materials to the musician.

0:57:02.734,0:57:04.253
And then you have reaction,

0:57:04.253,0:57:10.484
reactions on both sides, the musician will react to the AI, the AI will react to the musician.

0:57:10.484,0:57:12.712
And we have this creative loop.

0:57:12.712,0:57:16.615
So OMax had a lot of hairs and descendants,

0:57:16.615,0:57:23.215
and you see many popular systems that have been derived from or original researches

0:57:23.215,0:57:25.056
on the OMax paradigm.

0:57:25.056,0:57:33.223
And notably all the work that is done right now at Sony Music and now at Spotify is

0:57:33.223,0:57:39.120
(and also the) work done by François Pachet,

0:57:39.120,0:57:45.966
was immediately derived from our original research work at OMax.

0:57:45.966,0:57:48.505
So OMax has become a very important paradigm,

0:57:48.505,0:57:55.529
and we have moved from this paradigm to something even more interesting right now.

0:57:55.529,0:58:02.151
But let me just give you an idea of what this interaction paradigm is about.

0:58:02.151,0:58:05.967
So before learning, the system must listen.

0:58:05.967,0:58:10.560
So you must have a perception aware system of listening.

0:58:10.560,0:58:13.844
We call this machine or artificial listening,

0:58:13.844,0:58:19.410
so that we're gonna we're gonna segment the stream of music into

0:58:19.410,0:58:26.208
musical in it that will be distributed over some mathematical structure or maybe a geometry,

0:58:26.208,0:58:32.081
and we will discover with cognitive algorithm a symbolic alphabet structure.

0:58:32.081,0:58:39.284
Even though we are dealing with audio, we will discover a symbolic alphabet structure of on the musical unit

0:58:39.284,0:58:41.144
that will deliver a symbolic stream.

0:58:41.144,0:58:44.280
So from the symbolic stream we will learn a model.

0:58:44.280,0:58:46.880
So we will use a number of machine learning algorithm

0:58:46.880,0:58:50.092
and then regenerate and render new sequences.

0:58:50.092,0:58:54.523
And the three processes listen, learn, and generate, are real time and concurrent

0:58:54.523,0:59:02.293
and they are both concurrent and cooperative.

0:59:02.293,0:59:08.988
So the nice drawing that you see here is the visual representation of a musical sequence

0:59:08.988,0:59:11.050
that has been learned in real time by OMax.

0:59:11.050,0:59:20.473
And all the colored arcs that you see are actually connecting different places of the music with regard to similarity.

0:59:20.473,0:59:24.560
So because we have this connection created by the AI,

0:59:25.680,0:59:29.392
we have a kind of cartography of a map of the music.

0:59:29.392,0:59:38.201
And the system just have to navigate around this map to create new sequences that will be statistically coherent with the material that was learned,

0:59:38.201,0:59:40.253
but still creative and novel.

0:59:40.253,0:59:47.026
So you see here in this model you have the musician who is for instance improvising,

0:59:47.026,0:59:48.195
and there is a double loop.

0:59:48.195,0:59:55.302
He's listening to other musicians and but he's also, he or she, listening to to themselves,

0:59:55.302,0:59:58.228
and also listening to its sound memories.

0:59:58.228,1:00:00.564
So himself or herself in the past.

1:00:00.564,1:00:07.638
And the memory is a virtual part because it is constituted by all that the musician has played,

1:00:07.638,1:00:09.827
all that the other musicians are playing,

1:00:09.827,1:00:14.354
and all that the musician has ever played or learned in his life. So this is all virtual.

1:00:14.354,1:00:19.360
And this is exactly the musical memory that the AI system is simulating.

1:00:27.360,1:00:31.309
I'm hearing some music coming from somewhere.

1:00:31.309,1:00:32.055
Okay, okay okay.

1:00:32.055,1:00:38.855
Okay, so somax is like you know, this zero point here in this graph that represent two dimensions

1:00:38.855,1:00:46.602
where you have the reactive dimension the system reacts instantly to a musician.

1:00:46.602,1:00:54.947
and the planning dimension where the the user can actually plan behaviors like compose for instance 
a harmonic grid or any composition

1:00:54.947,1:00:58.491
so OMax is really at zero because it is not really planning

1:00:58.491,1:01:01.761
and it is not reactive but it has a lot of machine learning

1:01:01.761,1:01:06.140
so then we have we have developed more intelligent systems, like a smart system

1:01:06.140,1:01:11.212
where we have a high level of reactivity

1:01:11.212,1:01:15.319
we have developed the important system where we have a high level of planning

1:01:15.319,1:01:20.110
and now we are working 
on a hybrid system where we would have a good compromise

1:01:20.110,1:01:23.294
between being totally reactive to what the live musicians are doing

1:01:23.294,1:01:32.560
and also having some planning and being able to develop interesting 
and sophisticated and structured musical processes

1:01:33.360,1:01:41.680
so here is the the general diagram the that we are now exploring in the REACH project

1:01:43.200,1:01:45.544
where you have some musical input musical signal

1:01:45.544,1:01:51.772
you have a machine listening unit that creates a symbolic signal stream

1:01:51.772,1:01:58.772
you have a learning unit that will do some machine learning, statistical, probabilistic, or deep learning

1:01:58.772,1:02:05.772
that will learn a model and that will give back some information 
to the listening machine

1:02:05.772,1:02:10.927
so it will help the listening machine to improve itself

1:02:10.927,1:02:12.960
so the learning will create a memory model

1:02:14.000,1:02:17.887
where we will have an interaction agent

1:02:17.887,1:02:22.861
that will query the model in order to create new musical material

1:02:22.861,1:02:26.747
but that will still be listening to the 
musical stream in the input

1:02:26.747,1:02:32.878
so the interacting agent will be able also to be reactive and not 
only creative and generative

1:02:32.878,1:02:38.860
and the user will be able to specify scenarios so to compose some 
music

1:02:38.860,1:02:44.937
but then the interacting model will be able to give feedback control to the scenario unit

1:02:44.937,1:02:51.977
in order to be able to generate artificial scenarios that will be interacting with the user in general

1:02:51.977,1:02:58.089
so this is a highly sophisticated architecture that will be able to generate very interesting 
musical experiments

1:02:58.089,1:03:02.717
so now let me show you just two-minute video

1:03:02.717,1:03:07.872
where you will see some example or where we have reached so far

1:03:07.872,1:03:10.562
you will see a pianist playing

1:03:10.562,1:03:15.333
and at some point you will hear three singers edit *piaf elizabeth schwarzkopf*

1:03:15.333,1:03:18.092
and *b holidays* who are very famous singers

1:03:18.092,1:03:20.201
so we have used audio archives

1:03:20.201,1:03:25.888
but the AI which will totally re-improvise the audio archives

1:03:25.888,1:03:29.840
in order to align the improvisation with what the pianist is doing

1:03:29.840,1:03:44.159
♫Pianist playing♫

1:03:44.159,1:04:26.822
♫The AI starts improvising in real time♫

1:04:26.822,1:05:32.840
♫Epic collaboration between the pianist and the AI♫

1:05:34.400,1:05:35.840
oh sorry

1:05:38.161,1:05:43.079
♫Brief playback♫

1:05:46.744,1:06:30.960
♫Epic human-AI jam♫

1:06:30.960,1:06:33.461
okay so you have seen two examples

1:06:33.461,1:06:38.825
one was an offline example where the AI has learned a lot of materials from the three singers

1:06:38.825,1:06:44.105
and then is able to recompose and re-improvise in the audio domain

1:06:44.105,1:06:49.193
but as well also in the video domain the music

1:06:49.193,1:06:52.562
and in the last part of the video you have seen a real time example

1:06:52.562,1:06:59.218
where the system captures and learned his model in real time

1:06:59.218,1:07:02.206
from what the musician 
is actually performing

1:07:02.206,1:07:08.398
and is able to instantly interact and have a dialogue with the 
musician

1:07:08.398,1:07:12.508
so every time you were listening to the saxophone sound

1:07:12.508,1:07:15.263
and the musician was obviously not playing his instrument

1:07:15.263,1:07:20.374
it was the AI playing and proposing a dialogue to the to the musician

1:07:20.374,1:07:28.421
okay recently we have begun a national research agency project called MERCI

1:07:28.421,1:07:30.480
Mixed Musical Reality with Creative Insturments

1:07:32.880,1:07:35.203
where we have an industrial partner called HyVibe

1:07:35.203,1:07:42.242
and HyVibe has obtained a lot of awards in the industrial 
world

1:07:42.242,1:07:50.740
for instance there is the challenge award of the best startup for 2021

1:07:50.740,1:07:53.913
and they are designing a active acoustic system

1:07:53.913,1:08:07.851
that where they transform material devices into an acoustic diffusion system

1:08:07.851,1:08:11.116
and they have created they have 
created a new instrument called the HyVibe guitar

1:08:11.116,1:08:16.658
that is equipped with actuators and sensors and computing power inside the guitar

1:08:16.658,1:08:21.618
and where you can, you can have some processing of the sound of the guitar

1:08:21.618,1:08:26.727
that is rendered not by a loudspeaker but by the wooden body of 
the guitar itself

1:08:26.727,1:08:35.481
so it gives the the musician the feeling that the instrument is really reacting to what he's doing

1:08:35.481,1:08:37.840
so here's an example

1:08:37.840,1:08:45.120
♫Creative guitar performance♫

1:08:45.120,1:08:46.446
and another

1:08:46.446,1:08:54.800
♫Creative guitar performance♫

1:08:54.800,1:09:02.183
so so what we want to do is to be able to embed the artificial intelligence into the instrument

1:09:02.183,1:09:07.999
so this instrument is not only capable of extending the sound of the instrumentist

1:09:07.999,1:09:13.466
but also to add an intelligent musical layer to what the musician is 
doing

1:09:13.466,1:09:16.113
and maybe to co-improvise with the musician

1:09:16.113,1:09:18.330
and this is what we call co-creativity

1:09:18.330,1:09:26.394
when we have an interactive situation where a musician and a computer system are able to co-create or co-improvise

1:09:26.394,1:09:32.912
and this is where we get to the 
REACH project that has just begun the last year

1:09:32.912,1:09:39.682
where we are kind of wrapping up and summing up all this big experience

1:09:39.682,1:09:46.506
in writing AI system for interactive music creation

1:09:46.506,1:09:53.685
where we want to really really focus on what I call co-creativity 
between human and AI

1:09:53.685,1:10:00.133
emphasizing that creativity is an emerging dynamics resulting from 
complex interaction between actors

1:10:00.133,1:10:06.106
so it cannot be understood by considering each 
agent's production in separation

1:10:06.106,1:10:13.149
but on the contrary you have to consider really the sum of the behaviors of the agents

1:10:13.149,1:10:22.794
so this frees us from the concept of artificial creativity art artificial intelligence in the art

1:10:22.794,1:10:26.473
because creativity is not a state that 
you are trying to reach

1:10:26.473,1:10:28.880
it's a dynamical effect,

1:10:28.880,1:10:31.956
an emergent effect of interaction in a complex system

1:10:31.956,1:10:39.404
so you can never catch really what creativity or co-creativity is in a static way

1:10:39.404,1:10:42.147
it will only emerge in the time of interaction

1:10:42.147,1:10:45.376
this is the idea that we defined in REACH

1:10:45.376,1:10:52.897
so cyber-human co-creativity will appear when you have emergence of 
cohesive or contrasting joint behaviors

1:10:52.897,1:10:56.658
that you are not able to reduce to individual processes

1:10:56.658,1:11:02.020
and then you will have operation of non-linear regime of event and structure formation

1:11:02.020,1:11:04.468
that will create core evolutions of forms

1:11:04.468,1:11:07.606
and this happens because you have cross-learning processes

1:11:07.606,1:11:10.450
where the machine learns in real time from the musician

1:11:10.450,1:11:12.394
but the musician learns in real time from the machine

1:11:12.394,1:11:17.223
or in general agents that can be artificial or human

1:11:17.223,1:11:22.660
learn from one another in a cross way

1:11:22.660,1:11:28.377
and this will create complex 
feedback loops and reinforcement mechanism

1:11:28.377,1:11:32.432
that will favor the emergent mechanism

1:11:32.432,1:11:38.621
So a cyber physical system like the guitar for 
instance is a cyber physical system

1:11:38.621,1:11:43.100
they create an interaction continuity between digital and 
physical world

1:11:43.100,1:11:47.963
now we want to propose the term cyber audience for systems that create a synergy

1:11:47.963,1:11:52.558
between the digital models and the human mind the human creativity

1:11:52.558,1:11:56.523
so this is the the structure 
of REACH

1:11:56.523,1:12:00.514
but mainly what we have is two central tasks

1:12:00.514,1:12:03.854
that are kind of converging one to the other

1:12:03.854,1:12:09.941
one is to augment the digital agent's abilities with better AI algorithms

1:12:09.941,1:12:13.417
enhance creativity autonomy sensitivity to context

1:12:13.417,1:12:16.477
but also cyber physical extension like the guitar

1:12:16.477,1:12:19.285
so they can act in the material world

1:12:19.285,1:12:24.725
on the other side we will take the human and get it closer to 
the digital agent

1:12:24.725,1:12:30.704
by augmenting the human ability by interfacing them into embedded mixed realities

1:12:30.704,1:12:34.607
so for instance the the creative guitar that we are doing with HyVibe

1:12:34.607,1:12:37.110
is our first mixed reality instrument

1:12:37.110,1:12:46.795
so something that augments the the natural reality by a digital augmentation

1:12:46.795,1:12:49.796
so the REACH artistic impact is huge

1:12:49.796,1:12:55.639
recently we had the concert at the *maison de la jolla* music with 
the *orchest national the jazz*

1:12:55.639,1:13:00.776
and they were playing with our algorithm that were interacting in 
real time with the whole orchestra

1:13:00.776,1:13:03.181
which is more than 20 musicians

1:13:03.181,1:13:09.166
we have issued a new record and a book called "Artist This Year"

1:13:09.166,1:13:13.411
where you can listen to all this interactive concert with AI,

1:13:13.411,1:13:24.839
and you have 200 pages of critical analysis and commentary of the 
phenomenon of AI in art.

1:13:24.839,1:13:33.537
A lot of concerts festivals etc where all systems are actually 
used in real life

1:13:33.537,1:13:39.654
and I will just show a one minute video where you will see the same 
kind of human augmentation

1:13:39.654,1:13:44.211
but here is the video so we use the archive of Dianne Reeves' concert

1:13:44.211,1:13:45.774
at the Monterey Jazz Festival

1:13:45.774,1:13:49.160
and the archives is controlled by the AI in order

1:13:49.160,1:13:52.948
that it's able to 
react in real time to what the pianist is doing

1:13:52.948,1:15:21.200
♫The singer AI is reacting to the pianist♫

1:15:21.200,1:15:24.800
so thank you for your 
attention and I will stop here

1:15:27.840,1:15:30.639
Thank you very much Assayag-sensei

1:15:30.639,1:15:36.592
your presentation is very interesting and deepful (deeply insightful), thank you very much

1:15:36.592,1:15:41.997
and I failed to tell this earlier for our audience

1:15:41.997,1:15:48.259
if you have any questions please post questions to the chat

1:15:48.259,1:15:54.616
We will have Q&A later in this session

1:15:54.616,1:16:03.960
Then next, I would like to welcome Professor Jean-Pierre Merlet from INRIA

1:16:03.960,1:16:08.596
Merlet-sensei, could you please start your presentation?

1:16:08.596,1:16:11.499
Okay do you hear me?

1:16:14.800,1:16:16.720
okay I think you are

1:16:18.720,1:16:20.279
seeing my screen right?

1:16:20.279,1:16:25.805
uh I I'm sorry uh you have to monitor

1:16:25.805,1:16:28.160
yeah that's a problem

1:16:31.360,1:16:33.141
Ah, okay, let me see

1:16:33.141,1:16:37.760
Can you share the window on the left side

1:16:39.840,1:16:48.240
wait a minute I will activate the second screen

1:16:48.240,1:16:54.800
maybe you can share 
not for a monitor for only a window

1:16:58.240,1:17:01.840
oh

1:17:04.640,1:17:05.815
do you see my screen?

1:17:05.815,1:17:07.819
no

1:17:07.819,1:17:11.845
no? not yet

1:17:23.600,1:17:26.480
no you don't see anything?

1:17:26.480,1:17:33.280
and it's coming and maybe we 
can wait for a few seconds and I think it's going to be fine

1:17:33.280,1:17:38.446
sorry for that, I will disconnect my second screen

1:17:53.760,1:17:57.840
I don't know what is happening

1:18:08.320,1:18:11.840
zoom is not really working well for me

1:18:19.760,1:18:27.338
of course you can (you are) okay to share a full monitor, then I think you can

1:18:27.338,1:18:29.338
Yeah but

1:18:33.060,1:18:36.199
is that okay with you do you see my screen now?

1:18:38.560,1:18:40.014
did you see my screen?

1:18:40.014,1:18:41.840
No, I don't think so

1:18:41.840,1:18:44.540
No?

1:18:44.540,1:18:47.219
I don't know what is going on

1:18:49.839,1:18:55.359
I propose maybe you can send 
me your your presentation and I will

1:18:55.359,1:18:57.325
But yeah I have videos so

1:18:57.325,1:18:59.040
Oh you have videos

1:19:01.859,1:19:04.979
I don't understand, stop sharing?

1:19:06.800,1:19:14.320
and I'm really sorry because I have to update 
my zoom and the new one is not working

1:19:17.520,1:19:25.280
application windows okay maybe I can try 
that one and here do you see my screen?

1:19:27.440,1:19:27.940
hello?

1:19:27.940,1:19:30.093
no no no, I mean it's black

1:19:30.093,1:19:31.419
it's black yes

1:19:31.419,1:19:32.724
yeah only black

1:19:32.724,1:19:39.161
it's black? but it's written you started to share your screen

1:19:39.161,1:19:44.495
yeah I think I have a problem with my display system

1:19:44.495,1:19:49.840
I don't know

1:19:54.234,1:19:57.871
Um...

1:19:57.871,1:20:03.840
I don't know what is happening

1:20:20.800,1:20:22.361
so you don't see anything?

1:20:22.361,1:20:24.032
We don't see anything

1:20:24.032,1:20:28.862
I understand you are sharing your screen but we don't see anything

1:20:28.862,1:20:31.733
arriving on the screen actually

1:20:31.733,1:20:35.958
Okay, let's try again

1:20:42.643,1:20:47.379
Urg, I don't understand

1:20:50.240,1:20:55.967
you could hear the monitor for the first time

1:20:55.967,1:20:59.840
so yeah I, this is what I'm doing

1:21:03.600,1:21:05.315
do you see something?

1:21:05.315,1:21:06.766
no

1:21:06.766,1:21:07.360
an hear?

1:21:09.600,1:21:12.418
so you don't see my monitor at all right?

1:21:12.418,1:21:13.840
no

1:21:16.880,1:21:20.218
I'm sorry about that

1:21:23.440,1:21:27.840
I don't see

1:21:28.720,1:21:34.800
I don't understand this usually 
should work except for this problem of

1:21:39.520,1:21:43.440
maybe you can reconnect your 
(your last) your second screen and

1:21:44.800,1:21:46.158
this is what I have done

1:21:46.158,1:21:47.062
okay

1:21:47.062,1:21:47.971
but you don't see,

1:21:47.971,1:21:49.812
Jean-Pierre?

1:21:49.812,1:21:50.800
you don't see anything

1:21:50.800,1:21:51.661
Oui?

1:21:52.000,1:21:59.136
what if you, sorry hello everybody, what if you send your slides via file sender?

1:21:59.136,1:22:00.563
But the problem is that I

1:22:00.563,1:22:02.807
File sender? to download and...

1:22:02.807,1:22:06.067
yeah but the problem is that i 
have movies.

1:22:06.067,1:22:09.840
Ah you have too many yeah okay, sorry

1:22:12.320,1:22:16.800
okay but I will, maybe I can, I don't 
know why you don't see the screen

1:22:18.720,1:22:22.854
you can change the order of a presentation

1:22:22.854,1:22:27.520
for example you can switch Magali-san and Merlet-san

1:22:29.520,1:22:31.600
then we have some..

1:22:31.600,1:22:37.840
yeah but this this will not 
solve the just sharing problem we have

1:22:40.960,1:22:45.000
let me try something, you don't see anything at all right now?

1:22:45.000,1:22:47.879
A black screen or something like that?

1:22:48.320,1:22:49.619
just a black screen

1:22:49.619,1:22:50.599
black screen

1:22:50.599,1:22:57.131
okay so I'm sorry I don't know what 
I can do there

1:22:57.131,1:23:05.947
okay I can send for sure I can't send the presentation but this could be 
a pity because there are a lot of movies going on

1:23:05.947,1:23:11.280
maybe I will, okay you can 
switch I will try to reconnect and

1:23:13.120,1:23:16.000
maybe just try to disconnect and reconnect maybe

1:23:19.440,1:23:20.800
I can try that

1:23:22.701,1:23:23.760
yeah but

1:23:26.720,1:23:31.243
new share, let's try new share

1:23:36.400,1:23:39.001
let's try something else

1:23:39.001,1:23:41.519
you still don't see anything

1:23:41.519,1:23:42.357
no

1:23:42.357,1:23:43.180
right

1:23:45.360,1:23:50.320
and I'm really sorry about 
that I don't know what to do

1:23:53.280,1:23:59.272
this usually works except for this actually appears this morning

1:23:59.272,1:24:01.840
so maybe yes we can

1:24:03.280,1:24:10.640
close the zoom program, the zoom application then connect to zoom

1:24:10.640,1:24:15.840
okay I will do that I will 
disconnect and reconnect again

1:24:27.520,1:24:33.840
so maybe I don't know if someone has a question 
maybe we can take one question

1:24:33.840,1:24:46.080
yeah it's better to use this time to hold Q&A so if 
anyone has a question to audience (from audience)

1:24:53.200,1:25:00.880
Of course if you have question to Professor Tokui and Professor Asayag, and ask them also

1:25:00.880,1:25:04.859
yes, I have a question for Mr. Tokui

1:25:05.760,1:25:09.827
how did you create a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) for this?

1:25:09.827,1:25:19.935
because I think it's very difficult to create a discriminator for what is a right rhythm and wrong rhythm?

1:25:19.935,1:25:25.840
Or Marlet-san, could you please share?

1:25:32.649,1:25:35.535
(In Japanese) Oh, kitakitakita.

1:25:35.535,1:25:37.542
Marlet-san ok

1:25:39.340,1:25:39.840
it's very good

1:25:44.335,1:25:45.929
(In Japanese) Are? Kikoeta?

1:25:47.600,1:25:53.840
Marlet-san could you please say something

1:25:56.400,1:25:59.647
I can see your sharing monitor,

1:25:59.647,1:26:03.658
and sharing window, but I cannot hear your voice

1:26:09.920,1:26:13.250
(In Japanese) Are? Nanka,

1:26:32.527,1:26:33.335
(In Japanese) Hmm, Doushiyokkana

1:26:33.335,1:26:36.080
Fabien-san how can we do?

1:26:44.880,1:26:49.840
yeah I'm looking forward

1:26:51.520,1:26:53.552
very strange

1:27:06.800,1:27:08.451
(In Japanese) A, Kita

1:27:21.840,1:27:23.475
okay do you see my screen now?

1:27:24.274,1:27:27.063
Yes I can see

1:27:27.163,1:27:29.219
okay so I will

1:27:29.219,1:27:31.711
go fast to, sorry for some delay

1:27:31.711,1:27:37.511
so I'm Jean-Pierre Merlet 
I'm working as a robotician so I'm not an artist at all

1:27:37.511,1:27:40.271
I'm working in a team which is called HEPHAISTOS

1:27:40.271,1:27:45.503
which is working basically on providing assisted device for frail people

1:27:45.503,1:27:47.465
um

1:27:47.465,1:27:54.480
probably that 
I don't see my screen so I cannot go up and down

1:27:57.760,1:27:59.493
okay

1:27:59.493,1:28:05.252
so what are the benefits for 
scientists to work with athletes

1:28:05.252,1:28:06.867
this is the question I have to raise

1:28:06.867,1:28:09.543
what are 
the benefits for artists to work with scientists

1:28:09.543,1:28:14.960
those opposite and our other application 
domains may benefit from such a collaboration

1:28:16.320,1:28:18.845
it's difficult to work with artists for a 
scientist

1:28:18.845,1:28:22.503
and I assume that it's difficult for artists to work with scientists

1:28:22.503,1:28:24.050
because 
there are a lot of problems

1:28:24.050,1:28:28.343
so what are the benefits for scientists?

1:28:28.343,1:28:33.200
Well, you know in our research institution

1:28:33.200,1:28:38.275
it's not really expected and sometimes 
it's even seen as quite suspect

1:28:38.275,1:28:44.171
Furthermore, from an evaluation from a scientist evaluation 
viewpoint

1:28:44.171,1:28:47.866
it's difficult to evaluate because we don't have indicators

1:28:47.866,1:28:52.800
and collaboration with 
artists requires a huge understanding effort

1:28:55.280,1:28:58.179
what are the benefits for artists to work with 
scientists?

1:28:58.179,1:29:02.445
well a major difficulty is that

1:29:02.445,1:29:08.049
the scientist is some kind of in between 
between the artists and the work

1:29:08.049,1:29:09.840
most of them are

1:29:10.560,1:29:14.851
many of the artists are not aware of technological 
possibilities

1:29:14.851,1:29:22.296
so they have an attitude of self-censorship that limits the creativity

1:29:22.296,1:29:28.769
and 
they're also the understanding effort for our people

1:29:28.769,1:29:32.421
they have also to understand 
scientists

1:29:32.421,1:29:36.037
do you still hear me?

1:29:36.037,1:29:40.160
I'm not sure because I have absolutely 
no sound

1:29:40.160,1:29:42.240
no that's, yeah? it's okay

1:29:42.240,1:29:48.216
So let's go to to a practical example to show 
you that

1:29:48.216,1:29:51.840
in spite of these drawbacks we have

1:29:53.440,1:29:54.640
the possibility

1:29:54.640,1:29:57.600
and it's a very interesting 
possibility to collaborate with artists

1:29:58.400,1:30:02.046
I will illustrate site on this example where we 
have a robot

1:30:02.046,1:30:05.059
which is called the cable driven parallel robot

1:30:05.059,1:30:11.952
and the purpose of this robot is 
to be able to move the point b that you see on the drawing

1:30:11.952,1:30:16.043
the platform with this guy underside

1:30:16.043,1:30:20.338
moves 
his platform in all direction x y z

1:30:20.338,1:30:25.378
so we can raise the platform go to left go backwards and upward

1:30:25.378,1:30:30.069
and to do that, we have four cables

1:30:30.069,1:30:31.840
which 
are attached to the platform

1:30:32.480,1:30:37.206
and are also attached on the winch at point a

1:30:37.206,1:30:40.400
and the winch allowed to change the cable lengths

1:30:41.760,1:30:45.983
and by an appropriate control of the cable length

1:30:45.983,1:30:48.960
we can change the position of the platform at will

1:30:52.160,1:30:52.660
oops

1:30:54.960,1:31:00.116
there is an application of this kind of robot 
in the earth's domain

1:31:00.116,1:31:03.317
which is assistance to mobility for frail people

1:31:03.317,1:31:06.535
for example where we're 
making transfer operation

1:31:06.535,1:31:12.859
helping them to go for example to go to a sitting from a sitting 
position to a standing position

1:31:12.859,1:31:15.184
and also for working assistance

1:31:15.184,1:31:18.880
with the benefits of providing 
autonomy they are able to do something that

1:31:20.320,1:31:23.411
before they were not able to do alone

1:31:23.411,1:31:26.720
which 
improves self-esteem (and) improved social relationship

1:31:27.280,1:31:30.844
and it's also very interesting for doctors

1:31:30.844,1:31:32.741
for monitoring the health of the subject

1:31:32.741,1:31:37.135
because this platform is instrumented to give 
medical information

1:31:37.135,1:31:42.537
so let's just show me (let me show you) a short video

1:31:42.537,1:31:43.695
if it works

1:31:43.695,1:31:47.138
I hope you can see 
the video

1:31:47.138,1:31:49.446
you see a patient on the bed

1:31:49.446,1:31:51.312
the robot is coming down

1:31:51.312,1:31:53.916
the patient is in 
a medical harness

1:31:53.916,1:32:01.527
and I'm losing the job but basically the passion can do it alone

1:32:01.527,1:32:05.199
the robot will lift the passion to move her

1:32:05.199,1:32:06.744
in a wheelchair

1:32:06.744,1:32:11.588
so she will be now again 
fully autonomous

1:32:11.588,1:32:14.960
I will stop the video

1:32:17.760,1:32:22.889
but already this robot has this kind of having inclusion of art

1:32:22.889,1:32:26.604
so for example maybe you know the pink singer

1:32:26.604,1:32:29.490
and this is one of her 
public performance

1:32:29.490,1:32:35.401
she moves over the crowd using this cable powered robot

1:32:35.401,1:32:38.043
and you can see 
she will do something very french

1:32:38.043,1:32:42.055
at the point I don't see the video on the screen

1:32:42.055,1:32:44.259
you don't see the video?

1:32:44.259,1:32:45.440
no video

1:32:48.000,1:32:50.250
not this one not the previous one as 
well

1:32:50.250,1:32:50.750
pdf

1:32:50.750,1:32:53.536
I'm sorry but okay

1:32:53.536,1:32:57.178
this is probably the same issue with my screen

1:32:57.178,1:33:00.000
i 
will skip that for the sake of time

1:33:02.800,1:33:11.478
in 2018 we have a magic encounter with 
an artist whose name is Anne-Valérie Gasc

1:33:11.478,1:33:15.877
during a workshop devoted to the use of robot in 
architecture

1:33:15.877,1:33:18.880
and Anne-Valérie was looking for a machine

1:33:18.880,1:33:26.560
with the purpose of 3d printing a 
structure on large scale (with) dozens of metals

1:33:26.560,1:33:30.480
the printing material is glass microbeads

1:33:30.480,1:33:32.947
the machine has to follow a fixed trajectory

1:33:32.947,1:33:35.878
and deposit layers of glass powder

1:33:35.878,1:33:42.640
but there is no gluing element in the product so that the 
structure slowly collapse after each layer

1:33:44.720,1:33:49.840
and an exhibition of this structure 
was scheduled for the summer of 2019

1:33:50.480,1:33:53.040
in an art center located close to paris

1:33:55.520,1:33:58.206
we get interested in this project

1:33:58.206,1:34:06.675
because we have made a huge effort on the theoretical modeling and control of 
this kind of robot

1:34:06.675,1:34:14.304
we are interested in long-term deployment because this allowed to test the 
robustness of our system

1:34:14.304,1:34:18.688
and especially to detect failure understanding why something 
has failed

1:34:18.688,1:34:21.200
and detecting unexpected behaviors

1:34:23.200,1:34:28.240
the objectives we have was basically increasing 
the safety and performance of the system

1:34:30.160,1:34:34.733
for dealing with uh our assistance problem

1:34:34.733,1:34:40.075
so you see a picture of the exhibition place it was huge

1:34:40.075,1:34:45.840
the length was about 40 
meter so it's about 20 meter 25 meter

1:34:47.680,1:34:51.459
you see there's a drum that is moved by the robot

1:34:54.880,1:35:00.799
I will not show the video it's it's 
basically bad but I cannot do anything to get that

1:35:00.799,1:35:05.360
also maybe I try maybe let me 
try something

1:35:05.360,1:35:09.400
I hope I will not lose

1:35:20.320,1:35:22.658
maybe you switch the video now

1:35:25.954,1:35:28.146
Do you see the video?

1:35:28.146,1:35:31.136
ok, I can see

1:35:31.136,1:35:33.360
I don't hear you

1:35:33.360,1:35:35.944
I can see the video

1:35:35.944,1:35:38.943
okay, all right

1:35:40.430,1:35:47.120
So, (unintelligible noise)

1:35:47.120,1:35:54.242
and now it's deploying the powder on the structure

1:35:57.760,1:36:01.937
okay we'll stop the video move back to the 
talk

1:36:01.937,1:36:06.400
I hope you see the the slide now

1:36:08.080,1:36:10.716
so some result of this exhibition

1:36:10.716,1:36:14.071
the exhibition 
lasts for one month and a half

1:36:14.071,1:36:17.432
the robot traveled for more than four kilometers

1:36:17.432,1:36:23.323
walking in 
average four hours and fifteen minutes per day

1:36:23.323,1:36:28.350
76 layers of glass powder were deposited

1:36:28.350,1:36:31.120
which represents 1.5 tons of glass

1:36:31.920,1:36:33.661
and we have some failures

1:36:33.661,1:36:36.480
one cable 
breakdown during the installation

1:36:37.520,1:36:42.053
and two small failure encoder on one axis 
model

1:36:42.053,1:36:44.480
but so was it was not really important

1:36:46.800,1:36:50.382
next we move to ICRA 2020

1:36:50.382,1:36:59.180
the same exhibition was scheduled to be part of a big 
robotics conference

1:36:59.180,1:37:01.177
which is, whose name is ICRA

1:37:01.177,1:37:07.760
which have 5000 
plus participants in Paris during June 2020

1:37:07.760,1:37:14.480
we have improved the system but unfortunately 
ICRA was postponed because of the Covid

1:37:14.480,1:37:20.080
and our new exhibition will take place during the 
summer of this year in a museum close to to this

1:37:22.240,1:37:24.801
lesson learned

1:37:24.801,1:37:28.107
from art to science

1:37:28.107,1:37:33.852
we have 
received a huge benefit in taking part of the exhibition

1:37:33.852,1:37:42.380
from a scientific viewpoint we are a 
single team in a world which is able to master a very difficult issue in this kind of robots

1:37:42.380,1:37:47.200
furthermore this experiment they offer

1:37:47.200,1:37:50.880
unique test bed for researchers 
working on dune information

1:37:50.880,1:37:53.213
dunes formation modeling

1:37:53.213,1:37:59.360
but still many of the 
colleagues, our research colleagues, indicates that

1:37:59.360,1:38:00.629
more or less valley

1:38:00.629,1:38:01.594
yeah

1:38:01.594,1:38:04.160
could 
you please (move) back to the pdf?

1:38:06.240,1:38:07.663
back to?

1:38:07.663,1:38:14.415
we see the stopped video so 
could you please back to pdf?

1:38:14.415,1:38:17.439
okay um...

1:38:19.200,1:38:21.650
let me see

1:38:30.640,1:38:31.336
okay

1:38:31.336,1:38:33.069
now you sh...

1:38:33.069,1:38:34.488
okay you skip my slide

1:38:34.488,1:38:38.240
so I'm backing up lesson learned

1:38:38.240,1:38:42.080
from a scientific viewpoint this 
experiment was very interesting

1:38:42.080,1:38:49.920
but still many of our research colleagues state 
more or less overly that this is not real science

1:38:55.040,1:39:02.320
it's also said that the government's 
level of the interdisciplinarity is

1:39:02.320,1:39:03.978
very good is a necessity

1:39:03.978,1:39:08.880
but in the practice 
of such official speech is quite different

1:39:10.301,1:39:14.640
because the evaluation committee are not 
very comfortable with such a collaboration

1:39:17.440,1:39:23.507
what we need also is that discussion with doctors and artists have a lot of similarity

1:39:23.507,1:39:28.614
they have a different language (and) they have a different 
level of scientific knowledge

1:39:28.614,1:39:35.680
but for us it's quite uh interesting because this exhibition 
has facilitated our communication with doctors

1:39:37.200,1:39:40.287
now lesson learned from science to 
art

1:39:40.287,1:39:45.420
many artists believes that that animating an artwork is a complex and 
expensive task

1:39:45.420,1:39:53.200
this is no more true, even for motion except for very large artwork

1:39:53.200,1:40:00.084
To illustrate that in 2015 we have organized 
a workshop

1:40:00.084,1:40:02.631
called computer science for art

1:40:02.631,1:40:04.094
which results

1:40:04.094,1:40:06.061
so it was a five day workshop

1:40:06.061,1:40:09.280
which 
resulted in a concept at the end of the workshop

1:40:09.280,1:40:13.350
with the device developed by the artist during 
the workshop

1:40:13.350,1:40:15.684
and I can show you a picture of this concept

1:40:15.684,1:40:20.352
you see some strange machines that 
were making musics

1:40:20.352,1:40:22.640
both on the ground on the table

1:40:23.360,1:40:25.689
you see a dancer

1:40:25.689,1:40:29.467
for example the dancer as an 
accelerometer on her hand

1:40:29.467,1:40:33.109
so that the music was changing according to a motion

1:40:33.109,1:40:35.996
so I moved to conclusion

1:40:35.996,1:40:37.185
and sorry for the delay

1:40:37.185,1:40:43.590
for a scientist wondering on domains quite different from our 
main research field is very fruitful

1:40:43.590,1:40:48.684
this allows us to develop new algorithms new software newer 
methodologies

1:40:48.684,1:40:55.153
and all this work may be used for other research topics

1:40:55.153,1:41:01.058
in our case working with 
artists has allowed us to improve our medical device

1:41:01.058,1:41:04.156
facilitate our discussion with doctors

1:41:04.156,1:41:09.427
but also to better understand human acceptation of the device

1:41:09.427,1:41:12.318
which is quite essential 
for us

1:41:12.318,1:41:15.600
and to better understand the patients needs

1:41:15.600,1:41:20.201
so this will end my presentation, and sorry for 
the technical problem

1:41:20.201,1:41:22.480
thank you for your attention

1:41:25.360,1:41:30.080
thank you very much for an excellent demonstration

1:41:30.080,1:41:33.771
I understand this conclusion very much

1:41:33.771,1:41:46.494
so 
this time this is the end of a session one, and from now uh we'd like to have some Q&A 
session

1:41:46.494,1:41:53.218
so if any and anyone has a question for the speakers

1:41:53.218,1:42:02.181
could you please raise your 
hand or say something from my microphone?

1:42:03.280,1:42:04.479
hello

1:42:05.877,1:42:08.257
Please, Assayag-sensei

1:42:17.222,1:42:20.120
You have any question? no?

1:42:28.880,1:42:33.600
maybe you started a question 
uh quick you know maybe

1:42:33.600,1:42:36.705
yes I have so many questions

1:42:36.705,1:42:41.982
Assayag-sensei, I'm very interested by your presentation

1:42:41.982,1:42:50.458
I think IRCAM is very good to improve and advance the possibility of music

1:42:50.458,1:42:53.601
so I'm very impressed by your work

1:42:53.601,1:42:55.000
how can I say

1:42:55.000,1:42:59.179
the guitar with a vibration

1:42:59.179,1:43:08.339
so how what is the 
initial motivation of, to create this kind of guitar?

1:43:08.880,1:43:12.195
okay so uh as I said

1:43:12.195,1:43:17.613
one of the 
fundamentals of the REACH project

1:43:17.613,1:43:24.686
is to state that creativity shared with the machine

1:43:24.686,1:43:29.182
can only be an emergent process

1:43:29.182,1:43:34.979
that will appear in the course of interaction

1:43:34.979,1:43:45.491
and so that you cannot really describe what is creativity for a machine

1:43:45.491,1:43:48.851
and maybe this doesn't have even meaning

1:43:48.851,1:43:54.701
but you can describe creative or 
co-creative processes that are emerging

1:43:54.701,1:43:57.632
because you have a complex interaction 
between agents

1:43:57.632,1:44:03.874
artificial or humans who are related by a cross-learning 
phenomenon

1:44:03.874,1:44:07.907
so once we have moved into this realm

1:44:07.907,1:44:13.200
we have realized that in 
order to really have this convergence between

1:44:13.200,1:44:19.280
cyber augmentation which is augmenting the 
the the capacities of various algorithms

1:44:19.280,1:44:25.360
and human augmentation which is augmenting 
the capacities of human towards the algorithm

1:44:25.360,1:44:28.322
we needed, we really needed a physical step

1:44:28.322,1:44:34.196
that is a step where there would be some embodiment of the human

1:44:34.196,1:44:37.232
into the process of interacting with 
the machine

1:44:37.232,1:44:41.571
so the guitar is only the first try that we make

1:44:41.571,1:44:50.561
the first step of of trying to 
to to create the condition for such a physical embodiment of the human

1:44:50.561,1:45:00.849
by embedding the algorithm 
into a physical device that the human really has against his body and feels like an extension 
of the of his body

1:45:00.849,1:45:03.255
but it is just the first experiment of course

1:45:03.255,1:45:07.501
we would like to design many 
other instruments or any kind of devices

1:45:07.501,1:45:12.749
where this emergence of co-creativity between human and 
machines

1:45:12.749,1:45:16.379
will be really the result not only of an intellectual process

1:45:16.379,1:45:18.745
but of a physical embodiment 
of the human

1:45:18.745,1:45:22.875
and maybe sometimes because we we had a robotics presentation just before

1:45:22.875,1:45:28.681
and maybe also a physical embodiment of artificial creators too

1:45:28.681,1:45:36.080
thank you very much I'm very 
impressed by your idea of co-creativity with machine

1:45:36.080,1:45:40.389
and then I have one question to Mr. Tokui

1:45:40.389,1:45:44.271
and I already 
asked the question

1:45:44.271,1:45:46.160
so could you please answer it?

1:45:47.680,1:45:52.960
so how I train my GAN model 
on rhythm, that was question correct?

1:45:52.960,1:46:03.351
okay so maybe I was not so clear about my project

1:46:03.351,1:46:09.232
so the first step was uh to train a normal GAN model

1:46:09.232,1:46:13.802
a Generative Adversarial Network model on 
rhythm data

1:46:13.802,1:46:25.561
so it's I think relatively easy for you know GAN's network to capture the the essence of rhythm pattern

1:46:25.561,1:46:29.920
But I thought it's just

1:46:29.920,1:46:34.809
another imitation of human creativity in a way

1:46:34.809,1:46:46.124
that's why as a second step I added another discriminator to the original GAN framework

1:46:46.124,1:46:55.534
then the second discriminator is not is not expected to classify

1:46:55.534,1:47:05.606
training data from artificial data

1:47:05.606,1:47:13.520
but it's expected 
to classify the genre of music generated

1:47:15.944,1:47:27.319
so the original discriminator 
was trained to classify

1:47:27.319,1:47:31.579
the real data from the fake one right?

1:47:31.579,1:47:37.584
that's the core concept of the Generative Adversarial Network

1:47:37.584,1:47:46.240
then I added a second discriminator which 
does the classification of musical genres

1:47:48.880,1:48:00.374
so the origin generator 
was uh uh trained to confuse not only the original discriminator

1:48:00.374,1:48:06.312
but also the second genre 
classification discriminator

1:48:06.312,1:48:07.520
so I expect

1:48:09.280,1:48:19.876
at the end generator will be able to generate 
something that sounds like a realism pattern

1:48:19.876,1:48:27.945
but these are patterns that 
don't belong to any genres

1:48:27.945,1:48:36.082
So you created a triangle of discriminators combining them

1:48:36.082,1:48:40.519
I understand a little bit

1:48:40.519,1:48:43.200
Okay, Thank you very much

1:48:43.200,1:48:48.827
the original idea was, when you think about artists

1:48:48.827,1:48:56.018
maybe think about any famous artist, picasso for example

1:48:56.018,1:49:12.841
so he started to, you know, train himself to capture the...

1:49:12.841,1:49:17.069
Sorry, let me rephrase again

1:49:17.069,1:49:28.284
so picasso, or any other artist should start painting to imitate somebody 
else's style right?

1:49:28.284,1:49:32.362
so I want to be like this artist or that artist

1:49:32.362,1:49:48.559
But Picasso or any other artist at some point they start trying to deviate from the existing styles

1:49:48.559,1:49:57.777
so there is some kind of, like how I can say,

1:49:57.777,1:50:03.880
the conflict between 
like staying in the existing style

1:50:03.880,1:50:08.411
and also, like deviating from the existing style

1:50:08.411,1:50:14.188
so there is very delicate balance between these two directions

1:50:14.188,1:50:24.400
so I wanted to make 
realize that conflict within the GAN framework

1:50:24.400,1:50:26.350
yeah I understand okay.

1:50:26.350,1:50:32.979
you mean that all artists have uh their own discriminator in (of) their own

1:50:33.079,1:50:36.712
The one is to imitate another 
artist

1:50:36.712,1:50:43.640
and another discriminator is to escape from the uh traditional art

1:50:43.640,1:50:48.754
so i understand that it's very interesting and it works

1:50:48.754,1:50:49.716
very well

1:50:49.716,1:50:53.240
Thank you very much for your presentation

1:50:54.442,1:51:01.404
Merlet-san, can you hear me? I have a question for your presentation

1:51:01.404,1:51:11.519
And I understand that you are a scientist and 
uh have collaborated with us artists

1:51:11.519,1:51:17.600
So is there any point, the important point

1:51:17.600,1:51:24.418
to successful collaboration 
with artists?

1:51:24.418,1:51:26.259
what is the point

1:51:28.600,1:51:30.498
Ah, yeah

1:51:31.680,1:51:40.880
this is, we have to adopt a very different mind when working with artists

1:51:40.880,1:51:46.168
compared to other work we may do with companies 
and stuff like that

1:51:46.168,1:51:48.545
for two reasons

1:51:48.545,1:51:52.737
because they have the, main for many reasons in fact

1:51:52.737,1:51:58.150
they have a different language, and we have a different language

1:51:58.150,1:52:05.503
so we have to understand 
each other sometimes we use the same word but with different meaning

1:52:05.503,1:52:11.040
so that we need to create 
some kind of dictionary between the two community

1:52:12.401,1:52:20.882
then the artists are not always aware of all 
of our technological and scientific constraints

1:52:20.882,1:52:29.280
well what is really make me 
afraid (what makes me afraid) some time is that

1:52:29.280,1:52:36.498
when an artist tell me oh I have just a minor 
detail to change the system

1:52:36.498,1:52:44.338
the last time they the artists tell us because we work with many 
different artists but the one we are working with right now

1:52:44.338,1:52:51.280
the last time she tell me that 
results in 400 hours of work changing everything

1:52:51.280,1:52:52.705
But it's okay

1:52:52.705,1:53:02.182
at the same time we really 
learn from the way people are seeing our work

1:53:02.182,1:53:07.826
the view of the artist is very different from 
the view we have

1:53:07.826,1:53:10.449
and it's very close to what the passion tells

1:53:10.449,1:53:12.457
so it's very important to have this 
discussion with us

1:53:12.457,1:53:14.240
because it's opened our mind

1:53:16.941,1:53:21.924
Okay, thank you very much wonderful episode

1:53:21.924,1:53:28.200
And thank you for all and then we'd like to have some uh...

1:53:32.223,1:53:37.730
Tokui-sensei, can you read the chat screen?

1:53:37.730,1:53:43.939
Magali-san has a question to Tokui-sensei

1:53:46.240,1:53:49.491
sharing the same point of view uh which are the 
ownership

1:53:49.491,1:53:53.280
Ah, I see and this is not question I think

1:53:53.280,1:53:59.591
then I'd like to have a coffee break for now

1:53:59.591,1:54:05.037
and we can see the screen of a video from *arya material*

1:54:05.037,1:54:13.639
and you can see the 
video from (that) I took in this state in Europe

1:54:13.639,1:54:21.840
Look through the video with a cup of coffee and sandwich

1:54:32.240,1:58:55.800
*A video interview of a french person*

1:58:58.480,1:59:06.800
five years ago I saw some small demonstrations 
of it doing like really expressive remapping

1:59:06.800,1:59:13.842
from like gesture drawing to something somewhat 
photographic I thought that that was

1:59:13.842,1:59:20.248
an amazing way to encapsulate knowledge of the figure is 
in a neural network

1:59:20.248,1:59:26.204
I can see a lot of the same challenges that the neural network will try to 
understand

1:59:26.204,1:59:29.345
that an artist tries to understand

1:59:29.345,1:59:38.400
the artist controls it from his imagination and 
his ideas and then he kind of confers the routine

1:59:41.760,1:59:44.960
that's what I discovered that I was able to do

1:59:44.960,1:59:51.280
with the AI at a University I did arts 
but engineering was my primary degree

1:59:51.280,2:00:00.320
my work is somewhat of the understanding from 
engineering and then my artistic study as well

2:00:03.680,2:00:07.120
and so a lot of my photography 
initially was to support

2:00:07.120,2:00:11.360
my my own understanding but 
also the anatomy lectures

2:00:16.880,2:00:23.959
and that's usually how the the project starts 
with kind of a concept that I visualize in my imagination

2:00:23.959,2:00:29.840
and then I try to see if 
it fits within the techniques that I've

2:00:29.840,2:00:32.323
explored whether it was possible

2:00:32.323,2:00:35.920
I guess one 
of the reasons why maybe my stuff is different

2:00:36.800,2:00:43.680
I try really ridiculous ideas just to see how 
interestingly they fail that part of the process

2:00:43.680,2:00:51.533
is maybe a scientist or a researcher but even as 
an artist the failure is sometimes beautiful

2:00:51.533,2:01:00.640
I understand the boundaries of what machine learning 
can do and then just test it and see what happens

2:01:00.640,2:03:13.520
*Another video is playing back*

2:03:13.520,2:03:16.880
from Japan uh his name is Akira

2:03:16.880,2:03:24.000
just approached the idea of creating characters 
because he worked for me was like really

2:03:24.000,2:03:29.541
mind-blowing I decided to uh to find my way 
as well

2:03:29.541,2:03:34.735
I'm trying to convince myself to finish

2:03:34.735,2:03:46.334
so what I want to do is like a massive 
project I would say like 10 000 different creatures

2:03:46.334,2:03:55.840
the tools allow 
me to work on at this scale and I want to try to see what comes out of it

2:03:55.840,2:08:49.345
*Another video is playing back*

2:09:06.720,2:09:10.620
okay uh thank you very much

2:09:12.560,2:09:17.241
so I'd like to restart the session

2:09:17.241,2:09:20.720
from now we'd like to start session two

2:09:22.800,2:09:31.840
after the first presentator is professor 
Lionel Obadia from University of Lyon 2.

2:09:32.800,2:09:38.320
Obadia-sensei, thank you very 
much for attending this symposium

2:09:38.320,2:09:40.346
could you please start your presentation

2:09:40.346,2:09:42.467
I'm trying you hear me

2:09:42.467,2:09:44.634
yes I can hear you

2:09:44.634,2:09:49.691
all right fine I don't have videos and I hope 
everything will feel right for my presentation

2:09:49.691,2:09:55.058
and I'm really happy and to be there thanks 
for the invitation

2:09:55.058,2:09:59.709
I see that there are a couple of people that I know around the table

2:09:59.709,2:10:01.180
but it is 
another story

2:10:01.180,2:10:04.819
so I share my presentation right now

2:10:06.160,2:10:07.759
and

2:10:09.440,2:10:10.098
I can see

2:10:10.098,2:10:10.936
can you see it?

2:10:10.936,2:10:11.789
yes

2:10:11.789,2:10:15.967
all right let's 
go for it

2:10:15.967,2:10:19.040
I'm just trying to have this um

2:10:19.040,2:10:24.813
uh well well well, I'm sharing but I want to have 
this

2:10:24.813,2:10:26.244
okay I'm going like that

2:10:26.244,2:10:28.943
okay do you see just one one slide?

2:10:28.943,2:10:30.000
okay perfect

2:10:30.000,2:10:31.043
okay great

2:10:31.043,2:10:37.240
this is a very long title and a very short reflection that you will see

2:10:37.240,2:10:41.358
and I'm a social 
and cultural anthropology specialized in religion

2:10:41.358,2:10:44.533
Asian religion to be a clear

2:10:44.533,2:10:48.132
and I've recently, since a couple of years (ago),

2:10:48.132,2:10:54.439
I'm converting myself to the steganological study of 
digital technologies

2:10:54.439,2:10:58.000
and robotics and and so on

2:10:58.000,2:11:05.831
so just one point if I have a problem for the presentation

2:11:05.831,2:11:09.878
since I do not see, all right, I do not see my screen

2:11:09.878,2:11:20.878
yeah, and, so a couple of 
reflections starting from fieldwork that I've been conducting season since one two years ago

2:11:20.878,2:11:27.323
I tried 
to submit an ERC (European Research Council) advanced (grant) but uh unfortunately, they,

2:11:27.323,2:11:29.269
contrary to other colleagues around the table

2:11:29.269,2:11:33.032
it was not successful this time that it will be resubmitted this year

2:11:33.032,2:11:40.376
but digital magic and I'm 
quite glad to hear that professor Merlet talk about magic in the context of robotics

2:11:40.376,2:11:43.280
this is exactly what I'm trying to explore now

2:11:43.280,2:11:52.398
And so I will talk about today, humans and the the tendency and the and the trends in robotics

2:11:52.398,2:11:55.209
and in world society to consider 
that

2:11:55.209,2:12:02.037
robots and all these kind of 3d AI forms have to be human shaped

2:12:02.037,2:12:08.356
and what kind of cultural 
imagination it brings at the forefront of the agenda of a

2:12:08.356,2:12:13.120
reflection of technology and culture, 
technology and society, and technology and history

2:12:13.120,2:12:16.872
so we all know that the digital revolution impacts

2:12:16.872,2:12:22.226
coming in there in a wide range of form and effect (in) now

2:12:22.226,2:12:26.083
we all agree that we live in 
a networked connected world and society

2:12:26.083,2:12:29.088
and interaction with these devices, small ones (and) big ones

2:12:29.088,2:12:36.576
have become natural and natural means in our lexicon (to be) culturally accepted

2:12:36.576,2:12:43.957
So we are, many now studying these new attitudes representation and cultural frameworks and imagination

2:12:43.957,2:12:48.330
that give means to technology as they infused society and daily lives

2:12:48.330,2:12:55.743
and there is this kind 
of interaction in between technologies and culture and society complete

2:12:55.743,2:13:00.000
and ongoing uh feedback in between the two

2:13:00.080,2:13:02.991
my anthropological point of view

2:13:02.991,2:13:05.414
it's culturally focused, (and) it's comparative

2:13:05.414,2:13:11.559
and I'm conducting ethnography of labs, exhibitions, enterprises, university everywhere

2:13:11.559,2:13:20.349
where I can find people that are trying to design, develop, test, use, and socially distribute these very strange devices

2:13:20.349,2:13:21.877
called AI robots.

2:13:21.877,2:13:25.609
so I'm in the second month (as a) professor of anthropology at the University of Lyon

2:13:25.609,2:13:28.299
but I'm in the second month right now, in two labs.

2:13:28.299,2:13:33.672
The first one is (in french) Centre d'Internet de Sociétés, Center for the Study of Internet and Society

2:13:33.672,2:13:39.269
so this is all about communication device and the sharing information and so on

2:13:39.269,2:13:45.551
and I'm also associated member of the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de la Robotique

2:13:45.551,2:13:48.013
Institute for Intelligent System and Robotics

2:13:48.013,2:13:53.088
where I'm conducting my field work among other places

2:13:53.088,2:13:54.630
where I'm doing this field works

2:13:54.630,2:14:05.327
and my paper will emphasize images and belief through attitudes, cultural expression, (and cultural expression) at large including artistic one

2:14:05.327,2:14:09.653
but I will 
not talk about arts in this presentation today

2:14:09.653,2:14:14.789
this focus on robots especially robots, rather than AI and other digital device

2:14:14.789,2:14:18.526
this focus is mainly due to the fact that robots

2:14:18.526,2:14:27.998
indeed raise the crucial issue of human shape form of technological creations

2:14:27.998,2:14:34.990
so this paper is not on art except that I'm participating on an ongoing research

2:14:34.990,2:14:37.863
with people that were are working on art

2:14:37.863,2:14:44.143
this is a seminar titled robots on stage interdisciplinary conversions between robotic and theater

2:14:44.143,2:14:46.288
this is a network and people are working together

2:14:46.288,2:14:48.496
you can see an image of what they do

2:14:48.496,2:14:52.961
they are studying plays and robots in place and AI in plays (what the heck is he saying here???)

2:14:52.961,2:14:59.492
and this is one of the *place* that I've been studying and presented in this network

2:14:59.492,2:15:03.660
but my focus will be on arts let's say popular arts

2:15:03.660,2:15:05.885
the movies, literature and online

2:15:05.885,2:15:10.951
So these robots, AI and other so-called creators

2:15:10.951,2:15:14.172
as seen from the side of social sciences and humanities

2:15:14.172,2:15:20.093
means not users but designers to users on the human side

2:15:20.093,2:15:26.008
and the empirical studies demonstrate that we have the evidence that AI is everywhere

2:15:26.008,2:15:33.079
but still it is nowhere because sometimes with the lack of materiality and the previous papers

2:15:33.079,2:15:38.080
underscore this point that we have to materialize and that,

2:15:38.960,2:15:45.093
Eto-san, your own paper to put emphasis on the materialization and visualization

2:15:45.093,2:15:47.649
of these devices and software

2:15:47.649,2:15:51.280
so it depends on the perception of their silence and materiality

2:15:51.920,2:15:57.255
and the same for the degree of reality of the integration of this device in our life

2:15:57.255,2:16:01.289
unless I left beside the issue of cultural difference

2:16:01.289,2:16:05.501
in between France and Japan, and France and the United states and so on

2:16:05.501,2:16:12.109
and countries with a lower economic development for instance

2:16:12.109,2:16:19.200
where the issue of this technology is an issue of cultural framework by which this technology are understood

2:16:19.760,2:16:22.233
is raised in a quite different way

2:16:22.233,2:16:30.091
but we'll talk about culture and society in general because of the very fast generalization

2:16:30.091,2:16:34.075
then this is important to take into account that

2:16:34.075,2:16:38.504
there are the inequal social and cultural distribution of device

2:16:38.504,2:16:41.382
and their availabilities, skills, and knowledge

2:16:41.382,2:16:44.465
and I heard several times this morning

2:16:44.465,2:16:52.866
the issue 
of failures the issue of not understanding the issue of something wrong in the behavior of the machines

2:16:52.866,2:16:55.593
and still this is really important to understand

2:16:55.593,2:16:58.317
or as well what humans provide as meanings

2:16:58.317,2:17:01.320
and especially when it's about non-rational meanings.

2:17:01.320,2:17:10.290
again these robots AI software and algorithm and so on are distributed on a different scale

2:17:10.290,2:17:13.474
they are very small one that is hidden for instance

2:17:13.474,2:17:16.477
in a smartphone application

2:17:16.477,2:17:22.763
and other ones that take the shape of a big robot that you can face you can have a face-to-face interaction

2:17:22.763,2:17:28.560
then one thing is striking is the fact that

2:17:28.560,2:17:34.971
not most not all but a significant 
part of these devices are shaped against

2:17:34.971,2:17:39.977
the human face or human shape or 
human body shape

2:17:39.977,2:17:42.278
and it raised the question of

2:17:42.278,2:17:46.483
are we trying to make new humans or are they still (making) machines

2:17:46.483,2:17:54.552
and it raised the outcomes of the issue of mimesis in between 
humans and machine on both sides for instance

2:17:56.800,2:18:03.398
besides the issue that social sciences and humanities are trying to raise and trying to explore

2:18:03.398,2:18:07.798
is the interaction in between these humans and devices

2:18:07.798,2:18:15.043
and the correspondence in between human to human social relationship and human device relationships

2:18:15.043,2:18:18.058
and in reality only in imagination

2:18:18.058,2:18:21.919
and this is a war scenario for science fiction movies

2:18:22.720,2:18:27.520
machines to machine communication against human 
that you know that this is really dystopic

2:18:28.080,2:18:36.417
and a quite widespread scenario of robots against humans this is one of the most used

2:18:36.417,2:18:42.337
let's say a background by which we imagine uh the the future in movies

2:18:42.337,2:18:49.773
especially in famous north Americans (famous in north America)

2:18:49.773,2:18:55.373
so we have different side, different forms of materiality from flat devices

2:18:55.373,2:18:58.319
screen that are everywhere on 3d devices

2:18:58.319,2:18:59.574
robots for instance

2:18:59.574,2:19:02.844
and 3d that can be real

2:19:02.844,2:19:08.796
if you see a machine acting that's why it's on (what) the professor Merlet has demonstrated

2:19:08.796,2:19:12.998
but also, you can see also 3d device

2:19:12.998,2:19:14.413
this is a 3d representation

2:19:14.413,2:19:20.439
but what's new as an anthropologist I'm interested in the fact that they are continuities and rupture

2:19:20.439,2:19:25.922
in the relationships in between humans and material environment through techniques

2:19:25.922,2:19:29.503
and I'm quite fond of this theory that

2:19:29.503,2:19:33.897
imagine that there is kind of a ongoing relationship

2:19:33.897,2:19:36.960
to materiality and to things that we shape

2:19:38.080,2:19:43.979
so humans seems to have always been 
interested in mediating their relationship to reality

2:19:43.979,2:19:46.058
thanks to technology at large

2:19:46.058,2:19:49.037
start with very very primitive technologies

2:19:49.037,2:19:53.715
and it end up in hyper modern and quick massive wave of all these devices

2:19:53.715,2:19:55.759
that are colonizing our life

2:19:55.760,2:20:00.719
robots conversational agent algorithm software 
robots connected objects and so on

2:20:00.719,2:20:02.902
for many different purposes

2:20:02.902,2:20:06.567
domestic, military, education, artistic purpose for instance

2:20:06.567,2:20:12.969
or some AI generated arts or AI as an inspiration for artists as a 
representation

2:20:12.969,2:20:20.772
then we live in this new ecosystem of so-called "anthropology significant other" are mediated at

2:20:20.772,2:20:24.479
so the anthropological outlook on this

2:20:24.479,2:20:28.625
is that if we raise issues regarding our relationship

2:20:28.625,2:20:32.846
to AI technological device and robots for instance

2:20:32.846,2:20:36.468
there are already topics like ethics and trust,

2:20:36.468,2:20:42.632
something that has been already treated and discussed by psychology, philosophy, and law

2:20:42.632,2:20:45.967
but SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) can bring like a lot of dimension taste and proof

2:20:45.967,2:20:49.968
from the appeal to robots and AI

2:20:49.968,2:20:54.216
and belief in these devices are animating by something

2:20:54.216,2:20:58.709
and then anthropology, sorry for uh insisting on this point,

2:20:58.709,2:21:04.022
but want to highlight how humans are in practice creative with machine

2:21:04.022,2:21:09.850
and how also they inject imagination futuristic scenario and even present scenario

2:21:09.850,2:21:13.004
and how the scenario infused society

2:21:13.004,2:21:19.715
and my interest raised in the fact that this scenario also impacts different 
sectors society

2:21:19.715,2:21:24.969
including technological ones means that the people that are building these 
technologies

2:21:24.969,2:21:31.918
are actors like *OOO* and actors and they are influenced

2:21:31.918,2:21:36.640
from the best or for the worst influenced by this imaginary frames

2:21:36.640,2:21:42.720
and then I will focus on image and imagination through these screens and visual culture

2:21:42.720,2:21:49.920
but let's start for the beginning and these new mechanics, automatic robots

2:21:49.920,2:21:54.346
are located according to the frame of imagination at the frontiers between

2:21:54.346,2:21:57.665
humanity and the rationality between fiction and realism

2:21:57.665,2:22:05.545
and especially human with robots that capture maybe most, maybe more than even all the other ones

2:22:05.545,2:22:07.924
this kind of imagination

2:22:07.924,2:22:12.718
and then there is an interesting discussion in robotics right now

2:22:12.718,2:22:16.092
the tracing back to meteorological routes

2:22:16.092,2:22:19.359
this is a widespread tendency and there are two trends that

2:22:19.359,2:22:29.617
if you as an anthropologist read literature in robotics, not very technical, but more open to history and culture

2:22:29.617,2:22:34.377
and you see that there are sub-community of roboticians that think that

2:22:34.377,2:22:39.831
AI and robots are in rupture with ancient forms

2:22:39.831,2:22:43.172
means that it used to be some kind of representation

2:22:43.172,2:22:49.398
and either human shaped things, quasi human for instance,

2:22:49.398,2:22:55.654
TALOS that you see that has been built by *ephrais* and the *feistos* have already been mentioned today

2:22:55.654,2:22:59.599
not the program but the the ancient Greek code

2:22:59.600,2:23:10.314
and other ones that think that AI and robots are only the continuity of an ongoing mythological (and) mental scheme in the human brain

2:23:10.314,2:23:18.690
and these continuity can be seen as well in what is called now the animistic design of new technologies

2:23:18.690,2:23:22.259
and the idea that there is something inside

2:23:22.259,2:23:26.959
something that is haunting the technology something like a soul or something (adeptus mechanicus?)

2:23:26.959,2:23:34.884
that does it above or beyond um the rationality and the purely mechanic 
life of things

2:23:34.884,2:23:41.642
and this even turns to a modern religious robot I take two examples here

2:23:41.642,2:23:43.908
and one in China and one in the west

2:23:43.908,2:23:51.911
these are robot priest and in some context, even the religious system clearly accept the presence of robots

2:23:51.911,2:23:55.779
but as vehicles of belief

2:23:55.779,2:24:02.072
and one thing is really important is that we are witnessing something really really different now

2:24:02.072,2:24:09.448
it's a belief in robots and they believe in AI as religious schemes or as a religious object

2:24:09.448,2:24:13.679
and to mention the rise of the thanks to,

2:24:13.680,2:24:18.235
because of Levandowski who used to be a an engineer at Google

2:24:18.235,2:24:23.621
the first church of AI that considered that AI is a godlike create

2:24:23.621,2:24:30.800
but these robots, and I focus here only on robots,

2:24:30.800,2:24:34.376
it comes under a vast array of types and prototypes

2:24:34.376,2:24:39.745
you can have small parts of the body and you can have the full human humanoid body

2:24:39.745,2:24:48.260
and this is thanks to, also a clear and quick advance in personal robotics and biomimetics,

2:24:48.260,2:24:53.429
sensor elaboration, algorithm-inspired emotions, and and so on

2:24:53.429,2:24:58.939
that makes some of the uh organizations and enterprises creating robots

2:24:58.939,2:25:03.578
attempting to create robots more and more resembling to human bodies

2:25:03.578,2:25:08.484
and if you allow me a slogan, because anthropologists like to produce slogan,

2:25:08.484,2:25:14.804
Are we shifting from bios, the system setup, to bios life within these robots

2:25:14.804,2:25:22.406
and this is a kind of witnessing or revealing unveiling this obsession for anthropomorphism

2:25:22.406,2:25:29.831
and one thing is surprising, striking, is even the representation of AI as a software (on) the flat device

2:25:29.831,2:25:35.718
is anthropomorphized as you can see on the on the on the small picture on the right

2:25:35.718,2:25:40.037
because of intelligence and intelligence it's supposed to be in the brain

2:25:40.037,2:25:44.086
but there are also other theories about intelligence

2:25:44.086,2:25:46.318
anyway,

2:25:46.318,2:25:54.799
all this brings us to the idea that we start from and end up in the representation of human body.

2:25:54.799,2:26:00.758
and then these new programs in human centered AI and robotics tend to respond or seem to respond

2:26:00.758,2:26:07.457
to this human tendency to consider technology as a replication of living real hard actions.

2:26:07.457,2:26:14.516
But these humans are flat or 3d, almost human or meta human and so on,

2:26:14.516,2:26:20.736
range among very different forms

2:26:20.736,2:26:25.546
and only the adjective seems to validate

2:26:25.546,2:26:33.781
and you keep the human substantive noon and you take a lot of, they inspire a lot of adjectives (like humans, almost humans, and meta-humans),

2:26:33.781,2:26:42.459
depending on what you mean and there are at least three epistemological regimes that you can raise after this adjective

2:26:42.459,2:26:46.572
for instance, they said like humans almost humans are meta-humans,

2:26:46.572,2:26:53.348
if you consider that these humans resemble humans only if they are almost human

2:26:53.348,2:26:58.733
that they tend to be human that they will be one day, as human or just like human,

2:26:58.733,2:27:04.719
and the meta humans is they are supposed to be evolved humans

2:27:04.719,2:27:10.359
and in my research, I'm conducting a interesting experience (experiment),

2:27:10.359,2:27:17.197
in which I ask people to react in faith in front of all these meta humans for instance

2:27:17.197,2:27:22.238
you see that on my screen this is on the left but on your screen it may be on the right

2:27:22.238,2:27:29.333
this is this they are quite handsome lady this but this person does not exist because it's an AI generated face

2:27:29.333,2:27:34.640
and also there are these double humans for instance

2:27:34.640,2:28:07.760
this character of Star Wars that was in Star Wars one and died in the meantime and was recreated through AI techniques to incarnate a new character in recent uh star wars movie even if he's dead but he has the same face he has the same movement and of course he has the same voice and the digital human experience it's also interesting because it's a conversation conversational agent with face attitudes so you feel like you are talking with

2:28:07.760,2:28:16.398
something that is almost human not really human it's in between and creating a very very strange

2:28:16.398,2:28:24.318
different ways to being human race of course a series of questions and I'm trying to

2:28:24.318,2:28:31.920
frame them after different questions and different theoretical patterns to to

2:28:31.920,2:28:38.398
put concept on them first the issue that has been raised previously or as well the

2:28:38.398,2:28:47.520
acceptance of these virtual humans we I'm talking in front of people from Japan

2:28:47.520,2:28:55.680
so *mori's* famous uncanny valley is still a concept that will still discuss but was just

2:28:55.680,2:29:02.639
a very specific step in the perception and interaction with a very specific type of of

2:29:02.639,2:29:09.439
machine and robot but the uncanny valley has been widespread in the meantime and now this is a huge

2:29:09.439,2:29:16.799
concept that we can manipulate and redefine in order to understand what what's the thrill that

2:29:16.799,2:29:21.920
you have when you meet these non-humans but they are also human they are in between and

2:29:21.920,2:29:30.398
this is the open door to understanding the very magical thinking that is in between

2:29:30.398,2:29:36.478
humans and mesh so these devices assume different forms they are co-operative functional therapeutic

2:29:36.478,2:29:42.478
friendly assistive and so on and they create a vast array of emotion as well but these emotions

2:29:42.478,2:29:48.559
are mixed together they create anxiety fear for instance people are really afraid of robots thanks

2:29:48.559,2:29:55.760
are due to science fiction movies or literature but also because they are across the road of of

2:29:55.760,2:30:02.799
of robots and but this is not always the case most of the of the time the people have fun with

2:30:02.799,2:30:07.359
robots and there and to a certain extent and a very specific context they also feel

2:30:07.359,2:30:14.000
empathy and love and sense of security but I'm talking about this therapeutic robot's name *paul*

2:30:14.000,2:30:23.600
which is made for all people with a psychiatric psychological trouble and then they are

2:30:23.600,2:30:30.318
something that is coming in between what I call the three t but this isn't that time and if it

2:30:30.318,2:30:37.600
doesn't work please tell me and please create a space for discussion in order to contradict these

2:30:37.600,2:30:44.398
these these atoms to theorize the human to robots relationships the tools of this robot

2:30:44.398,2:30:49.920
are first tools but they are also toys we are playing with these devices and coming back to

2:30:49.920,2:30:56.079
this in in a second and they are also conditions I mean temptation because we create something more

2:30:56.079,2:31:01.920
than a relationship we get also emotions and we are committed to this device for instance

2:31:01.920,2:31:08.959
this kind of obsession with this device up to sexual desires because now we are

2:31:08.959,2:31:14.959
witnessing the rise of sexual robots and not only in Asian countries but also in Europe and north

2:31:14.959,2:31:23.760
America and then I think that and this may be also a certain way to get closer to the artistic milieu

2:31:23.760,2:31:29.600
thinking about play play in three different terms of three different definitions of the terms

2:31:29.600,2:31:34.639
first is playing with reality we are in a game and there is something happening that we know

2:31:34.639,2:31:41.120
this is not exactly reality but we are trying to play with reality and the second is to play

2:31:41.120,2:31:47.680
in a non-real but real context I mean playing like you are a character in a theater then you

2:31:47.680,2:31:53.040
knew you know that you are doing something that seems real but it's not real that's like a game

2:31:53.040,2:32:00.559
but now you are playing like a character and all this brings us to play as fun because people

2:32:00.559,2:32:07.840
enjoy doing this thing they enjoy they are they have a lot of positive emotion and they are also

2:32:07.840,2:32:16.079
counterbalanced by negative emotions at that time but these emotions this effervescence against

2:32:16.079,2:32:22.639
robots and the relationship with robots give rise to really interesting scenarios from the

2:32:22.639,2:32:30.079
science fiction and there are four examples of robots that are purely autonomous imaginative

2:32:30.079,2:32:35.840
they are driven by emotions even if they are not supposed to have emotion for instance in the

2:32:35.840,2:32:42.478
the lady on the right is a robot named *arisa* in a series that you can find on Netflix better than us

2:32:42.478,2:32:49.760
and she ends up in sacrificing herself to prevent the life of the family and she is

2:32:49.760,2:32:56.719
in love with the dad of the family but there as you can see also *yule bruner* just before is

2:32:56.719,2:33:05.359
is a pure emotionless robot he's killing people in the first movie in the 70s of of

2:33:05.359,2:33:13.760
Westworld but he's driven by anger so he shows no emotion but he's killing people because

2:33:13.760,2:33:21.200
he wants to he wants revenge against the human all this is developed in the realm of scenario in

2:33:21.200,2:33:28.398
the real imagination and so on but on the field when I'm studying for instance in the easier

2:33:28.398,2:33:34.639
this this robot that you can see on the on the left the so-called *baxter* robot in which their

2:33:34.639,2:33:42.879
motion trying to trying to make this motion more sophisticated and the two examples taken

2:33:42.879,2:33:48.398
from an exhibition in which they are collaborative robots small ones that are supposed to be vacuum

2:33:48.398,2:33:54.639
cleaner robots collaborative with each other and the famous paper which is welcoming people at the

2:33:54.639,2:34:02.559
start the at the door of the exhibition and then we get back to a crude reality and

2:34:02.559,2:34:08.719
one of the researchers in robotics told me we are quite far from terminator and around three

2:34:08.719,2:34:15.680
and then why there are so different narrative and you know that we know we all know that

2:34:15.680,2:34:22.398
technologies are embedded in nets of meaning and to enter it in this narrative but do these

2:34:22.398,2:34:29.680
autonomous devices need narrative and of what kind and I allow myself the the chance to divide this

2:34:29.680,2:34:34.318
narrative in between scientific narrative and fiction narrative even if they mix each other

2:34:34.318,2:34:40.639
the distinction between the the two of them is just purely theoretical but scientific narratives

2:34:40.639,2:34:47.680
tell history of technology and fiction narrative that history about about technology and leave room

2:34:47.680,2:34:54.719
to very strange things that are coming up to be reality right now for instance imagining that

2:34:54.719,2:35:01.680
there are robots everywhere like in the drawings helping children helping elder people and bringing

2:35:01.680,2:35:08.159
parcels to homes and so on and making love with a robot find something that you can imagine but

2:35:08.159,2:35:14.959
these two images are also counterbalanced by the fact that we already have uh

2:35:14.959,2:35:24.559
virtual girlfriends in Japan and so this wasn't essay and and the papers in

2:35:24.559,2:35:30.959
helping for elder people in their homes so we are not quite far from scientific and

2:35:30.959,2:35:36.879
fiction narrative in the reality that we are living but the most interesting is not that

2:35:36.879,2:35:42.959
okay we can explore and explore and explore these fictional narratives but these narratives end up

2:35:42.959,2:35:48.959
being storytelling for robotics organizations and enterprises first there are a lot of people

2:35:48.959,2:35:54.478
are telling us that this is the story this is a theological narrative we are going

2:35:54.478,2:36:00.318
towards the inescapable origin of robots in society and that's almost human in society and

2:36:00.318,2:36:08.959
there are two famous enterprises that use a lot of media technologies such as YouTube to produce

2:36:08.959,2:36:16.959
different videos Hanson Robotics and Boston Dynamics they are very famous and the first one is

2:36:16.959,2:36:24.719
created Sofia. This human shape robot face which is able to have a conversation with the humans

2:36:24.719,2:36:35.280
and these are very famous very sports robots that are keen to accomplish very very difficult

2:36:35.280,2:36:43.439
motions and these are very spectacular performance and they are broadcast intentionally by these

2:36:43.439,2:36:48.639
enterprises and this is fascinating for the wide audience and a lot of people discussing this as

2:36:48.639,2:36:56.639
oh this is the future robots you see that women robots and these these very strong and even

2:36:56.639,2:37:01.200
military robots and but this is upsetting for the robotician I'm working with

2:37:01.200,2:37:06.318
they said okay this is just spectacular things but this is not the reality of robotics

2:37:06.318,2:37:13.280
as it is developing right now but interestingly these same atoms to

2:37:13.280,2:37:20.478
broadcast the the performance of robotics brings about dystopian scenario and this is all

2:37:20.478,2:37:29.760
except for the killer robot down in the slide but the two ones the robots is fighting back

2:37:29.760,2:37:35.040
Boston Dynamics roadways is fighting back against human and Sofia from Hanson Robotics telling

2:37:35.040,2:37:44.559
okay I will destroy humans these are fake fake videos but this means that the kind of genius

2:37:44.559,2:37:51.120
side of the of the coin when you try to broadcast an utopian future and said okay we live with

2:37:51.120,2:37:59.359
this very very powerful performance and very powerful robots and immediately they are also

2:37:59.359,2:38:06.318
contrary visions and contrary imaginations and then it brings me I'm almost finished to the what

2:38:06.318,2:38:12.478
i call the cultural walls in digital revolution because my approach is also a sociological one

2:38:12.478,2:38:17.040
I'm trying to understand position discourse and framework of imagination and the way they are

2:38:17.040,2:38:24.559
intentions and from this field work I'm framed for *ideative* attitudes to AI and robots especially

2:38:24.559,2:38:29.200
robots in this case what I call technologies that means engineers and technicians that are

2:38:29.200,2:38:35.359
elaborating robots and most of them told me that okay this is all but spectacular screen and this

2:38:35.359,2:38:41.280
is a software and we are trying to frame algorithm and then to see to test the movement and the part

2:38:41.280,2:38:47.840
of the law and so on and this is quite long and quite rigorous way of of doing things and on

2:38:47.840,2:38:54.159
the other side they are what I call technologies don't leave guys that come on TV and write books

2:38:54.159,2:38:59.760
and say okay the future of the digital age will be robots everywhere sometimes they are the same

2:38:59.760,2:39:07.120
Elon Musk for instance is a pure technology and these prophets of the digital age

2:39:07.120,2:39:17.359
and describe the future as a full of these devices may be it for critic critics be it for kind of

2:39:17.359,2:39:24.079
*valorization* of this also there are technophilians developers and users that are fascinated by these

2:39:24.079,2:39:30.879
new technologies and technophobians okay four positions but the surprise come by the fact that

2:39:30.879,2:39:38.879
we are not only and not really in a face-to-face confrontation with you on the one side those

2:39:38.879,2:39:44.799
who believe in the future of robots and robotics and say okay there are technologies we live robots

2:39:44.799,2:39:51.280
will be like gods like new angels like new spirits of the time and the other side technologies that

2:39:51.280,2:39:56.478
bring this back to the crude reality and saying that this is not exactly that this

2:39:56.478,2:40:04.318
we have to be rationalists this is all all but all that reality and more most of the time we find in

2:40:04.318,2:40:09.520
the scientific literature this kind of tension between rationality and irrationality but it's

2:40:09.520,2:40:14.799
much more complex than that because first I give two examples technologies for instance can

2:40:14.799,2:40:20.879
be technophobians and in my field work I met some people that create robots but fear the development

2:40:20.879,2:40:26.719
of AI in the same time these are the same people and this is the complexity of human feelings and

2:40:26.719,2:40:32.398
human attitudes and for instance on the other way technophilians people that like this

2:40:32.398,2:40:38.719
technology are not always always technologies and most of the user in your ignore the process on and

2:40:38.719,2:40:46.159
the design of creating technologies and finally technologies can inspire but not always and annoy

2:40:46.159,2:40:51.840
but also inspire technologies for instance we know that in France they are they have been not in

2:40:51.840,2:40:59.200
France not only but elsewhere invitation from the government and the organization and invitation

2:40:59.200,2:41:06.159
for scientists and authors to imagine matching and scenario for the for the future so it's not only

2:41:06.159,2:41:12.559
coming from the technological mid and slide and I'm finished and sometimes technologist

2:41:12.559,2:41:17.600
meets technology and there is at least one enterprise in France I'm doing field work with who

2:41:17.600,2:41:25.439
level their products enchanted tools and I set up even a marvel section because when they create AI

2:41:25.439,2:41:30.799
and robots they know that they are designed with their own history and the imaginary framework they

2:41:30.799,2:41:36.559
sell you the robots and the cultural and symbolic universe of the robot they all come together

2:41:36.559,2:41:42.398
and like Alice in Wonderland in the same time you cannot have without the others and

2:41:42.398,2:41:48.159
this kind of reconciliation in between fiction and science fiction between imagination and technology

2:41:48.159,2:41:56.000
then this is thanks to imagination robots then there are more much more in the line of

2:41:56.000,2:42:03.040
social exception acceptation and and this enterprise is supposed to be on the technologist

2:42:03.040,2:42:11.359
really rationalist regional side leave room for imagination and help this creative

2:42:11.359,2:42:19.520
relationship with robots and a.m and blur the frontiers and give party ground for imagination

2:42:19.520,2:42:27.200
I come from the east side of the of the creators of rob and at final reflection just a sum up of

2:42:27.200,2:42:34.079
these points this is all again an ongoing research and these are some results but not all the results

2:42:34.079,2:42:40.559
this paper was just to reflect upon the issues of sciences I determined to a digital revolution

2:42:40.559,2:42:46.559
and a very specific object in digital revolution especially robots and the anthropological point

2:42:46.559,2:42:51.600
of view that has been adopted here was from the bottom from the actor's point of view

2:42:51.600,2:42:57.840
and how and why and who produce what kind of technological imagination or imagination

2:42:57.840,2:43:04.639
projected on technologies and these human shape devices that are present here today are a good

2:43:04.639,2:43:11.520
example but are not the only one and all have been said now I might be counter balanced and

2:43:11.520,2:43:16.879
critically converted to other devices and other conditions of producting and using these

2:43:16.879,2:43:24.318
technologies of course these are technologies are also source of different kind of images and

2:43:24.318,2:43:32.318
surrounded by a different framework of imagination but my conclusion is creative imagination is not

2:43:32.318,2:43:38.559
always where we think it is and the appropriation of these devices in the media of artistic media

2:43:38.559,2:43:50.879
is a key evidence of this point but my look was on the technological media and the and widening

2:43:50.879,2:43:58.318
communities of roboticians and this imaginary cultural imaginary then can nurture or prevent

2:43:58.318,2:44:05.840
the advance of and in technologies I mean and this is my final conclusion we always from side to

2:44:05.840,2:44:11.760
side from the beginning of thinking about robots a and digital technology and producing them and

2:44:11.760,2:44:19.120
distributing disseminating them in in societies and culture think about the the very crucial role

2:44:19.120,2:44:29.920
of imagination it means images and ideologies surrounding these technologies thank you

2:44:29.920,2:44:37.920
thank you very much professor Obadia for wonderful presentation and i

2:44:37.920,2:44:46.239
love this kind of topics so I have so many issues to this I'd like to discuss with you

2:44:46.239,2:44:53.439
but the first I'd like to start the two three more presentation for this session

2:44:53.439,2:45:04.398
then I'd like to discuss all with us so the next I'd like to welcome miss Biin Shen from China

2:45:04.398,2:45:13.760
she's an artist and she's a great artist and I'm honored to be welcome(ing) here Biin Shen

2:45:13.760,2:45:21.680
could you please start your presentation? sure thanks Eto-san for the introduction

2:45:21.680,2:45:30.799
so today I'm going to share some of the experience I developed after I returned to China

2:45:30.799,2:45:53.600
so it's great to be here and so I'm sharing the screen now can you see it can you see it

2:45:53.600,2:46:06.478
sorry let me just, yeah so I will ask my avatar to do this presentation for me today

2:46:06.478,2:46:18.879
okay who okay

2:46:18.879,2:46:24.719
yes I can hear you no doubt that technology has played an increasingly important role

2:46:24.719,2:46:30.639
since the 20th century humans have to face multiple crisis and dilemmas

2:46:30.639,2:46:39.279
from nature society and humans themselves. In such a closely interconnected world can the collisions

2:46:39.279,2:46:51.200
of different cultures and ideas inspire creations that helps technology develop the better solutions

2:46:51.200,2:46:57.920
hello everyone my name is *Vincent* thanks to Dr. *either* for the invitation it's my great

2:46:57.920,2:47:03.120
pleasure to be here with other professionals at this workshop

2:47:03.120,2:47:09.359
I'm interested in the relationship between humans and technology to be more specific

2:47:09.359,2:47:15.040
I'm interested in how humans perceive or understand technology in a different culture

2:47:15.040,2:47:20.239
I have studied at m8 design interactions with professor *raby* at the London Royal

2:47:20.239,2:47:30.239
College of Arts that's also why a part of my work includes speculative future scenarios

2:47:30.239,2:47:37.600
technology has been around since the dawn of humanity from stones for hunting to sticks to join

2:47:37.600,2:47:44.159
all of which are the products of technology in human society in this time although

2:47:44.159,2:47:51.920
technology is presented similarly in general due to the globalization nowadays since I moved back

2:47:51.920,2:47:55.040
I have found a common phenomenon in China

2:47:55.040,2:48:05.920
people have a pretty different view of technology than what I haven't seen in other countries

2:48:05.920,2:48:09.439
there is a park at center of beijing called

2:48:09.439,2:48:14.799
temple of heaven which seems to have become a testing ground for local creativity of

2:48:14.799,2:48:25.279
innovation even the toilet in this park have equipped it with face recognition technology

2:48:25.279,2:48:31.359
going to the loo in his park must not be an overly urgent task like in no times you can

2:48:31.359,2:48:36.398
only get the pieces of toilet paper after taking off your head and your glasses and staring at the

2:48:36.398,2:48:43.600
machine for three seconds the slowly dripped toilet paper is limited each time so if you

2:48:43.600,2:48:51.439
need more you may have to repeat the progress a few times before go into the toilet oh and

2:48:51.439,2:49:00.799
you can also get the toilet paper from the front looking of pikachu I have texted through my phone

2:49:00.799,2:49:05.439
there are many more cases here from a noodles performance robot

2:49:05.439,2:49:12.559
to a piano that can grill lamp kebabs to the Shenzhen's smartphones Chinese citizens

2:49:12.559,2:49:20.239
have unique optimistic altitudes on technology these attitudes re-establishments how they live

2:49:20.239,2:49:29.040
in their living environment which also influenced my art creations

2:49:29.040,2:49:35.680
the ancient Chinese cosmology there's a set of thoughts and rules behind the seemingly magical

2:49:35.680,2:49:45.040
talisman it is a virtual miss blended with reality such as rim making ceremony and at the same time

2:49:45.040,2:49:52.239
is the most sensory reflection of how people at each time have understood their natural

2:49:52.239,2:50:01.040
environment resembles the way how algorithms and data shapes are meant *fulu* is a thousand *talisman*

2:50:01.040,2:50:09.120
that uses writing a meditation spell and spiritual power to scare away evil spirits attract fortune

2:50:09.120,2:50:16.639
or perceived peace in the space they are hung up or paced onto *fulu* is a drawing consisting

2:50:16.639,2:50:24.398
of Chinese characters with a mythological origin more than writing that merely describes the word

2:50:24.398,2:50:32.478
these characters have a magical relationship with them that allows them to act upon reality nowadays

2:50:32.478,2:50:39.680
the word of network's *timo lecra* gradually adopts and even replaces reality benefit *tissue's*

2:50:39.680,2:50:46.879
narrative of data becomes resources or even capsule the emergence of blockchain technology

2:50:46.879,2:50:54.239
and its decentralized worldview make it possible for internet nomads to build a better life

2:50:54.239,2:51:02.318
and these fictions are often regarded as objective depictions of reality

2:51:02.318,2:51:10.000
the character "Shu" in old Chinese means method skill extending from the meaning of the past

2:51:10.000,2:51:16.318
"Shu" also expressed both technology and the witchcraft which presents fiction there are also

2:51:16.318,2:51:24.079
cases of fictional transformations of reality in the records of dynasty in the novel heroes

2:51:24.079,2:51:31.439
of wood marine may eventually their depictions of diced monks and rivers who armed solely with diced

2:51:31.439,2:51:42.000
tools and witchcraft were able to overcome the machines and bring liberation for exploited people

2:51:42.000,2:51:49.760
continuing with this fiction or ancient wish of the Qing Dynasty I have created a speculative work

2:51:49.760,2:51:57.359
a series of contemporary fools for the society that is entirely overtaken by technology

2:51:57.359,2:52:04.318
this attempts to help people break the current human dilemma that both by the technology

2:52:04.318,2:52:10.000
and to explore the value of fictional realities

2:52:10.000,2:52:15.279
in this work I invited Hong Kong calligrapher *quinzo* to invent

2:52:15.279,2:52:21.439
some food together to harness the invisible magnetism of algorithms in combination with

2:52:21.439,2:52:28.159
ancient beliefs for example the image on the screen is for bitcoin holders it can

2:52:28.159,2:52:36.879
convert any electronic devices into a bitcoin mining machine for attracting more bitcoins

2:52:36.879,2:52:55.120
we decided to let this alternative future so so now you can get those flu online

2:52:55.120,2:52:58.000
technology

2:52:58.000,2:53:07.439
new techniques a type of liberation and autonomy or just enough

2:53:07.439,2:53:17.840
use in space be liberated or trapped

2:53:17.840,2:53:22.478
in his book

2:53:22.478,2:53:28.719
only

2:53:28.719,2:53:35.920
thoughts have succeeded in tips but

2:53:35.920,2:53:43.680
also helped general products not all Asian

2:53:43.680,2:53:59.439
essentially in the exact nature like this

2:53:59.439,2:54:04.159
hmm

2:54:04.159,2:54:08.559
peace on

2:54:08.559,2:54:12.719
is is it disconnected

2:54:12.719,2:54:20.959
hello b sound are you here hello okay I think I saw some icons appear on my laptop said

2:54:20.959,2:54:27.760
connection is not good can you hear me now can you hear me now yes yes

2:54:27.760,2:54:45.040
okay so I will start sharing again okay okay can I say it yes okay cool

2:54:45.040,2:54:49.040
you

2:54:49.040,2:54:58.159
to allow the public to encounter their world anew a German noise assignment transported 1999

2:54:58.159,2:55:04.959
used smartphones on trolley surreal streets of Berlin and google maps recognized this activity

2:55:04.959,2:55:11.600
by turning a green street red and automatically producing a virtual traffic jam on the map

2:55:11.600,2:55:17.439
the fictional activity also affected the physical world where smart navigation

2:55:17.439,2:55:28.000
directed cars to alternative routes to avoid being stuck in this traffic this is not racket

2:55:28.000,2:55:37.279
poses potentially to generate fictions often take as accurate attentions of reality another example

2:55:37.279,2:55:44.159
is Sunday island image at the right side was featured by google earth through their satellites

2:55:44.159,2:55:52.159
imagery and market in the contemporary digital charts such as google maps from 1876 until October

2:55:52.159,2:55:59.200
2012 when scientists finally discovered that the island have never existed the marina favor is a

2:55:59.200,2:56:05.680
network commissioned by unesco creative cities to critique the relationship between humans and

2:56:05.680,2:56:12.559
technology as game is one of the common mechanism used in my creative practice I have built a

2:56:12.559,2:56:19.120
telephone game with the artificial intelligence program tits translated in his work the text

2:56:19.120,2:56:25.600
is translated between 10 rooted and distant language families to decipher the original text

2:56:25.600,2:56:31.840
after the text has been translated and re-translated the original meaning is lost and the

2:56:31.840,2:56:39.760
cyber formatted linguistic endpoints is obtained the project results from negotiating questions

2:56:39.760,2:56:46.719
such as chameleon be accurately represented in translation from human accessibility to machine

2:56:46.719,2:56:54.478
logic what does it say about us trusting the perfection of computers over the sentimentally

2:56:54.478,2:57:00.879
of humans using these questions as a foundation running human or philosophical

2:57:00.879,2:57:10.159
text through a programmatic data obscures the language mechanically the resulting text

2:57:10.159,2:57:16.559
visual images its final step relieves on the intuitive and imprecise thinking

2:57:16.559,2:57:24.159
that mirrors human perception english writer and creative

2:57:24.159,2:57:33.359
we only see what we look at to look is an act of choice I think art is particularly important

2:57:33.359,2:57:39.439
in this area than ever as everything in its reality is attached to capsule

2:57:39.439,2:57:47.520
by reviving the power of fiction art change the real world in the current technological context

2:57:47.520,2:57:54.079
to generate awareness for technology for work citizens to rethink their current states

2:57:54.079,2:58:04.559
to catalysts for the better futures and that's my talk today thank you very much

2:58:04.559,2:58:13.120
oh wow oh thank you very much your presentation is also an art hard work

2:58:13.120,2:58:20.398
very beautiful thank you very much yeah yeah thank you very much

2:58:20.398,2:58:28.000
i have many questions to you but I'd like to proceed to the next presentation

2:58:28.000,2:58:35.920
then and let's discuss so I'd like to welcome mangaly and martin mozarix from inaliya

2:58:35.920,2:58:45.200
so could you please start your presentation yes I'm sharing my screen thank you

2:58:45.200,2:58:49.920
and that's

2:58:49.920,2:58:56.398
oops so

2:58:56.398,2:59:07.840
is it working yes it is indeed so thank you again for inviting us and my name is Magali and

2:59:07.840,2:59:14.318
in the name of INRIA, CNRS, and *lucia* and Terra Numerica we would like to to thank you

2:59:14.318,2:59:25.279
you Dr. Koichiro Eto-san for this invite and also the french and Japanese foundation and early kid

2:59:25.279,2:59:30.639
i'm sorry but our presentation is going to be very different because it's to share the

2:59:30.639,2:59:38.159
project we are working on at the moment in help maritime in the south of France sophia antipolis

2:59:38.159,2:59:44.000
and thank you to all of you for your excellent and exciting presentation and

2:59:44.000,2:59:50.559
i'm still very very impressed by being shane as well and it's going to be hard

2:59:50.559,2:59:58.079
to talk after her so Terra Numerica is digital sciences at your fingertips it's

2:59:58.079,3:00:04.079
something like we would like people to discover explore and experiment

3:00:04.079,3:00:13.840
so why Terra Numerica because like gravity digital is like everywhere and yet

3:00:13.840,3:00:22.318
digital till divide

3:00:22.318,3:00:29.840
people know how to use their phone their laptop but they don't know how what's behind it and

3:00:29.840,3:00:38.799
for Terra Numerica it's very important to engage people and and and share with

3:00:38.799,3:00:47.840
them so they can be independent with digitals and what's going on in this in this a new world

3:00:47.840,3:00:59.520
so very often we hear that these are not my cup of tea and despite the very good quality of

3:00:59.520,3:01:07.120
qual of science mediation with high attendance at science fair open doors conferences

3:01:07.120,3:01:16.043
courses digital is not yet considered not as a part of our culture as art is

3:01:16.043,3:01:26.026
 so therefore, we sorry I'm not very up, so therefore Terra Numerica wants to

3:01:26.026,3:01:31.875
disseminate the knowledge to the largest possible number of people,

3:01:31.875,3:01:44.879
and we aim at being a good vector for digital sciences in education and then bring equal opportunities for everybody boys and girls

3:01:44.879,3:01:53.200
also why Terra Numerica in our territory it's a very rich territory in interactions with

3:01:53.200,3:02:03.279
arts as you may know the south of France *alpha 19 bar* provence (name of a province?)

3:02:03.279,3:02:13.520
was, is still a very attractive place for artists so many came and stay and and produce in in the

3:02:13.520,3:02:24.000
area it's a very rich territory for art schools and like victorian studios as recently reopened

3:02:24.000,3:02:34.398
so cinema interactions lots of students and in society police and in nice and too long as well

3:02:34.398,3:02:45.680
a lot of research centers and private companies so very big nice area to to share and to to carry on

3:02:45.680,3:02:50.879
so the main goal of Terra Numerica was to bring together the whole digital sciences

3:02:50.879,3:03:01.439
actor which were on our territory and it was to not build well build something new but also

3:03:01.439,3:03:08.719
bring together all the people to make their experience and expertise in scientific meditation

3:03:08.719,3:03:17.600
their innovation creativity co-activities stronger also we very we're very keen in training

3:03:17.600,3:03:29.120
teachers professors and and sharing devices all devices around digital sciences

3:03:29.120,3:03:33.279
so Terra Numerica is a project still

3:03:33.279,3:03:42.159
it started we are now very I'm sorry sorry sorry sorry he lost my

3:03:42.159,3:03:51.439
we are now supported by our two funding members *cnrs India and universite cote d'azur*

3:03:51.439,3:04:01.120
we we have fully members from different areas like research and higher education laboratories

3:04:01.120,3:04:10.398
schools association private companies and local authorities as well our goal is to finally have

3:04:10.398,3:04:20.639
a big space to share and to show digital sciences but not only all the earn their interactivities

3:04:20.639,3:04:32.719
but also we are very keen on going in mainly in *interland* area because lots of secondary

3:04:32.719,3:04:43.439
schools high schools multimedia libraries don't always have access to those opportunities

3:04:43.439,3:04:53.760
we we have very open we are very open-minded and we've got like at the moment 150 people

3:04:53.760,3:05:01.040
working all together and including citizens students scientific administrative

3:05:01.040,3:05:07.200
staff artists everybody is is very welcome

3:05:07.200,3:05:18.398
so to give you a brief history of the project the project was born in into December 2018.

3:05:18.398,3:05:30.000
we were only four at the moment so in in 2 2019 we had to present and convince people and finally

3:05:30.000,3:05:38.318
we got a name and a logo which is Terra Numerica we got our first funding and first a key

3:05:38.318,3:05:55.279
achievement for Terra Numerica in 2020, then 2021 It was time for our, sorry our

3:05:55.279,3:06:02.719
research centers to sign an agreement and to encourage us to to carry on

3:06:02.719,3:06:10.478
so 2020 is 2022 is a big step for us because we are going to have a new pad as we said a very

3:06:10.478,3:06:19.200
big space 500 square meters where we are going to put down everything and it's going to be

3:06:19.200,3:06:26.879
able a place for sharing for researchers and people citizens to come and enter and

3:06:26.879,3:06:38.478
visit visitors and attend any kind of activities and the final goal for Terra Numerica in 2025

3:06:38.478,3:06:47.600
with the help of the local authorities is to open a dedicated place

3:06:47.600,3:06:56.398
to science meditation sorry meditation popularization of digital sciences and

3:06:56.398,3:07:04.000
we had the confirmation a few months ago so we are going to have like

3:07:04.000,3:07:12.318
5500 meters just for Terra Numerica, and just next to it, same place in Sophia Antipolis

3:07:12.318,3:07:21.279
5500 square meters for art and science linked to Terra Numerica and in connections

3:07:21.279,3:07:28.239
and after that the adventurers goes on we've got to carry on and work and produce and invent

3:07:28.239,3:07:36.959
and be different and attract more people so this is the place we we are going to

3:07:36.959,3:07:45.040
invest very soon where people are will be able to come and and visit and

3:07:45.040,3:07:52.639
it will be like the digital science fair all your all year round sorry and what we want is

3:07:52.639,3:08:03.279
to support innovative thinking inspire create share with everybody who's happy to come and

3:08:03.279,3:08:12.639
also we've got a little well not a little we would like to develop art and science in our project

3:08:12.639,3:08:19.200
and so just let open the windows on art and science and

3:08:19.200,3:08:22.869
as Picasso said everything you can imagine is real,

3:08:22.869,3:08:27.379
and this is what we are doing with Terra Numerica but not only

3:08:27.379,3:08:35.912
so we've got an agreement with Espace Art Concret de Mouans Sartoux and we are going to work

3:08:35.912,3:08:42.719
we are already working with them like Jean-Pierre as well showed you his project he's going to work

3:08:42.719,3:08:49.760
with with them as well and we would like to cross views between artists and scientists

3:08:49.760,3:08:56.959
so that could be a different level, like for instance the first example is Robert Delaunay

3:08:56.959,3:09:04.079
and you can as an artist, the creation and what an artist at INRIA can create

3:09:04.079,3:09:15.040
around the Delaunay Triangulations producing producing algorithm so that's an example

3:09:15.040,3:09:23.600
another example could be that that's a neural networks from another artist at INRIA,

3:09:23.600,3:09:32.159
and how your imagination could interpret neural networks in a different way

3:09:32.159,3:09:40.159
one of our scientists *Frederick Avi* who could not be there and *dorian mazurik* they both work

3:09:40.159,3:09:51.760
with this Espace Art Concret and for instance this is the work of Carl Andre which is a famous sculpturer,

3:09:51.760,3:09:57.051
American sculpture and it's the queens of, on the work of art, 

3:09:57.051,3:10:04.605
and it's mixing arts, mathematics, and algorithm as you can see.

3:10:04.605,3:10:10.719
Also we've got heart is everywhere and there is another

3:10:10.719,3:10:19.359
project which is a spiral is in shape and it's an approach a multi-disciplinary approach and in this

3:10:19.359,3:10:28.318
case we want to erase awareness of observation reflection via the spiral as a mathematical

3:10:28.318,3:10:37.200
object or sharing with science and technology but not only like for instance the origami

3:10:37.200,3:10:46.318
origami to us could be a way to also introduce deep learning but very *vulgarated*

3:10:46.318,3:10:55.520
but deep learning as you repeat the same gesture to train and to make your origami become alive

3:10:55.520,3:11:02.079
so that could be you know lots of connections to explain science and the interconnections between

3:11:02.079,3:11:09.439
heart history of art and and whatever okay so we are

3:11:09.439,3:11:17.680
beginning to be a bigger project with a lot of ambitions and any contributions would be very very

3:11:17.680,3:11:25.200
welcome, we can share with you seminars creative and innovating project

3:11:25.200,3:11:32.238
and also from what we heard this morning new scientific research approaches

3:11:32.238,3:11:42.719
and it would be very important for us to carry on any kind of collaboration so

3:11:42.719,3:11:53.279
this is just a little video I hope it works and

3:11:53.279,3:12:12.959
huh

3:12:12.959,3:12:15.520
oops

3:12:15.520,3:12:22.719
so thank you very much to *harry gatou gozaimasu* we will we heard about your

3:12:22.719,3:12:28.398
summer school at the beginning and we would be very happy to maybe collaborate with you

3:12:28.398,3:12:37.680
also in next November in society police at *indriya* we're on organizing an *aca* tech with

3:12:37.680,3:12:44.959
young students and researchers and one of the major group research area would

3:12:44.959,3:12:52.559
be heart and sciences because we believe we can create and do lots of new things

3:12:52.559,3:13:03.760
and we we've got to in in the area we also hold the project *troisi ah* Koichiro Eto-san

3:13:03.760,3:13:08.639
you you've already heard about it so you could have a lot of interactions

3:13:08.639,3:13:18.959
around AI with a lot of scientists but not only twice a year Terra Numerica have

3:13:18.959,3:13:27.520
called for projects so we've got little finance to give the opportunity to artists or to scientists

3:13:27.520,3:13:38.719
to collaborate and to work together and being a non-artist and a non-scientific and living with

3:13:38.719,3:13:48.079
living and working with scientific and artists I believe that there is no that's it's not a

3:13:48.079,3:13:54.959
different word it's the same word sometimes as Jean-Pierre and some of you already said

3:13:54.959,3:14:02.639
the communication the the wording is not the same but the creativity and your sensitivity is just

3:14:02.639,3:14:12.159
the same always, I often hear mathematician say oh I'm so happy my algorithm is so beautiful

3:14:12.159,3:14:22.879
and it's in the same aspect that an artist could share his whatever production and also my final

3:14:22.879,3:14:31.398
sharing is next time we would be very honored to make a little video for Terra Numerica

3:14:31.398,3:14:38.639
or whatever and talk with now Tokui-sensei and maybe have his music

3:14:38.639,3:14:46.639
in back in the background to be more innovative thank you again (in Japanese) arigatou gozaimasu!

3:14:46.639,3:14:53.760
thank you very much for your presentation Magali-san then our presentation was

3:14:53.760,3:15:02.879
finished for session two so we'd like to start a discussion of of this session

3:15:02.879,3:15:12.639
then thank you thank you for all then I'd like to start a question to from myself

3:15:12.639,3:15:23.680
so why do you say can you hear me yeah I do yeah maybe you you have a limited time to so I'd like

3:15:23.680,3:15:32.799
to start question for you no no I i actually have plenty of time because if if it's

3:15:32.799,3:15:37.040
a quarter to ten two two up past 12 in France this is

3:15:37.040,3:15:43.359
one hour left I'm in Great Britain now so I have a lot of time not a lot but I have time

3:15:43.359,3:15:51.680
okay thank you I I'd like to ask you the many questions but at the first one point

3:15:51.680,3:16:00.238
how do you think the differences between the west and the east was for thinking about the

3:16:00.238,3:16:10.000
dystopia scenario for the future I i think that there is a how can I say increased by from the

3:16:10.000,3:16:20.159
fiction novel for example Frankenstein as you know a scientific science fiction novelist

3:16:20.159,3:16:29.760
Isaac Asimov named it as a syndrome of a Frankenstein so how do you think the

3:16:29.760,3:16:40.159
scenario is different for the west and the east oh the question of cultural relativity I heard that

3:16:40.159,3:16:47.120
well, we have the same I have, I'm jumping aside and I'm coming back to the discussion right

3:16:47.120,3:16:54.238
now. I'm also working on another *media-tech* and the cultural creator named the zombie and you

3:16:54.238,3:16:59.439
know there is huge discussion regarding if it's a production of the western imagination and if it

3:16:59.439,3:17:05.920
can also be rooted in the in non-western culture and civilization given that the relationship

3:17:05.920,3:17:12.478
in between the body culture the imagination of after after death and so on are quite different

3:17:12.478,3:17:19.120
from way on the way to another depending not only on culture but and I'm getting back

3:17:19.120,3:17:28.639
to the point on history you know that the the on not only culture but also history

3:17:28.639,3:17:34.000
for instance the the degree of historical trauma that you have for instance for walls

3:17:34.000,3:17:40.559
and the very specific relationship that you can have with technology and for instance you

3:17:40.559,3:17:46.879
Japan invented Godzilla and now this is the universal feature now the character that we

3:17:46.879,3:17:54.398
we can see everywhere but you invited it and and this now belongs to the global popular culture

3:17:54.398,3:18:03.120
and it can be recognized everywhere and so I think that there are framework for dystopian scenarios

3:18:03.120,3:18:12.079
similar on some aspects with a local variations regarding the very specific national history

3:18:12.079,3:18:18.639
let's say on the background of global history but but national histories for instance

3:18:18.639,3:18:26.159
and that's why there is a huge distribution of of this dystopian scenarios but if you

3:18:26.159,3:18:32.159
allow me just one more second I'm a bit talkative but just one second this dystopian

3:18:32.159,3:18:38.879
scenarios has also grounds for the acceptation of this for instance the fact that we all know

3:18:38.879,3:18:48.000
who is Frankenstein creator and we all accepted that we can create such let's say animals or

3:18:48.000,3:18:55.040
or human-like creatures regardless of the the outcomes and the fact that the creator can kill

3:18:55.040,3:19:03.760
the the create creator can kill the creator but you can fear a very specific scheme or object or

3:19:03.760,3:19:10.879
sign of symbol but accept it and dystopian can also be imaginary indeed

3:19:10.879,3:19:19.920
geological ideological facilitator for the acceptation of these things in my opinion

3:19:19.920,3:19:26.079
interesting I have this kind of a scientific fiction story

3:19:26.079,3:19:34.238
there are so many cultural background differences so maybe we can deepen this kind of stories

3:19:34.238,3:19:44.639
very much but I'd like to make broader to this topics so I'd like to ask you being

3:19:44.639,3:19:54.478
some how do you think the described stories from the east side and your presentation is

3:19:54.478,3:20:05.520
wonderful and also it's playful so I'm very interested in your story to a playful future

3:20:05.520,3:20:12.000
ah president can you can repeat the question again sorry I think the internet is not

3:20:12.000,3:20:22.799
evil in the you created the future scenario as a good site or a prayer site

3:20:22.799,3:20:30.478
I'm very interested in where did you come from this kind of attitude altitude you mean

3:20:30.478,3:20:39.040
the work I just created oh yeah okay well I think it's quite it's quite complicated because as

3:20:39.040,3:20:47.840
an artist I think any experience is going to our creation so I think my creation slightly

3:20:47.840,3:20:55.680
starts changing because I was moved back to China since 2020 and from then I think the whole

3:20:55.680,3:21:01.279
involvement and also the people how people are using the technology and the people's optimistic

3:21:01.279,3:21:08.238
altitudes on the technology in this whole environment is quite shocked me so so that that's

3:21:08.238,3:21:14.879
you can see that's my analyze of how what happens in these environments like from my slides

3:21:14.879,3:21:22.238
just in my presentation and so from that I was thinking compared to the study I would

3:21:22.238,3:21:31.680
compare to the the life experience when I was in London and I seen like quite different view

3:21:31.680,3:21:39.760
in China that everyone can so close engage with the technology that they bring the technology

3:21:39.760,3:21:49.600
fragments into their daily lives and then so in that case I think here everybody is artists

3:21:49.600,3:21:56.879
they are creating they're creating their how can I say they use their creation to

3:21:56.879,3:22:06.478
actually build the future day by day person by person and so when I seen this also I was raising

3:22:06.478,3:22:13.200
myself as an artist was the responsibility of being an artist in this technological arrow

3:22:13.200,3:22:20.398
so basically I'm more like critics on technology through my artworks and uh

3:22:20.398,3:22:29.920
and yeah that's that's that's experience again from from the from Beijing from China here

3:22:29.920,3:22:33.279
I'm not sure if I don't say it

3:22:33.279,3:22:41.359
yeah it's wonderful answer that everybody is an artist in China yeah

3:22:41.359,3:22:47.920
it's quite like you can't really you can't really feel which parts is the reality and

3:22:47.920,3:22:59.040
which part is fiction it's kind of all mixed up together the things you see in

3:22:59.040,3:23:07.439
it may next day appear in a daily life like in China you never know every day is a surprise

3:23:07.439,3:23:14.478
interesting thank you very much

3:23:14.478,3:23:27.279
for sang can you hear me magazine I have a question for you that how would you like to

3:23:27.279,3:23:37.120
make a place to collaborate with artists in your project can you hear me

3:23:37.120,3:23:41.040
nobody saying

3:23:41.040,3:23:46.799
he is not in a list of the names anymore wow

3:23:46.799,3:23:50.398
okay then

3:23:50.398,3:23:56.318
she came here again

3:23:56.318,3:24:04.398
if somebody have questions to speakers you can feel free to uh

3:24:04.398,3:24:14.238
on microphone then start to talk or please say something from chat

3:24:14.238,3:24:18.478
can you hear me

3:24:18.478,3:24:28.000
yes sorry *shiro* I lost you and I had to connect again ah okay so I'd like to I'll repeat the

3:24:28.000,3:24:36.079
question to you okay thank you I have a question is it any plan to make a collaborative

3:24:36.079,3:24:45.680
collaborative space in your project is there any future plan to collaborate with artists

3:24:45.680,3:24:54.159
oh yes indeed we we would like to to do that I mean Jean-Pierre is already an example

3:24:54.159,3:25:04.719
so far we have approached the Art Concret in Mouans Sartoux, but we would like to carry on and extend and

3:25:04.719,3:25:12.159
even outside the area the national I mean the France or elsewhere because like

3:25:12.159,3:25:23.920
we are going to have one 1 500 meters dedicated to art and science and it's very important to

3:25:23.920,3:25:32.000
to collaborate and to extend and so there are so many local artists as well it's a very rich

3:25:32.000,3:25:39.520
territory so yes we are very keen on on collaborating Koichiro with

3:25:39.520,3:25:44.799
you or any person who would like and also it is very important as you said

3:25:44.799,3:25:51.600
it's opening a new reflection on science aspects like with social environment

3:25:51.600,3:25:59.680
and with heart and the connections and I gather our project it's at uh

3:25:59.680,3:26:04.799
at a level just under your creativity

3:26:04.799,3:26:11.680
because for us the important is to share like we explain *AI* with a wooden

3:26:11.680,3:26:21.920
machine we've got lots of and it's to make people more confident and to show them that

3:26:21.920,3:26:31.200
digital a is everywhere but like art is everywhere as well to us so it's important that people trust

3:26:31.200,3:26:37.589
and feel more confident and it's like religion as Lionel, 

3:26:37.589,3:26:42.435
I think it was Lionel (who) made (them) the relation,

3:26:42.435,3:26:46.502
I mean it's everyday you've got to convince people you've got, 

3:26:46.502,3:26:55.279
and especially after what we've been through with the Covid you can all see that there is a lack of on

3:26:55.279,3:27:02.959
believing in science or in scientists so the problematics is everywhere and we've got to

3:27:02.959,3:27:08.959
carry on but yes we will be very happy to collaborate

3:27:08.959,3:27:17.920
I'm looking forward to collaborating with you yes we ideally we would we would have loved to welcome

3:27:17.920,3:27:25.040
you in March sometimes but because you are going back to Japan maybe next time with pleasure

3:27:25.040,3:27:33.359
Koichiro yeah thank you very much thank you so this is a time for discussion so is there any

3:27:33.359,3:27:54.159
questions between a speaker to a speaker we we are welcome to talk we have from you

3:27:54.159,3:28:04.238
i have one but meditate it will bring us very far okay I can try to jump here

3:28:04.238,3:28:10.639
since you work with the on the one side there is a close connection with artists and on the other

3:28:10.639,3:28:22.318
side you are working as in the heart of technology how do you get the issue of crafting

3:28:22.318,3:28:26.879
on the one side and creating on the other side all together

3:28:26.879,3:28:31.840
this is not an easy question this is a theoretical question I'm sorry for that but I know that there

3:28:31.840,3:28:38.159
are spaces right now in sciences where creation yeah you know crafting science is really inspired

3:28:38.159,3:28:53.520
by art and reciprocally so both of you are one of you how do you tackle this issue

3:28:53.520,3:29:01.840
well okay we have the main research area which is assistance for frail people

3:29:01.840,3:29:08.159
but at the same time we allowed us to wander

3:29:08.159,3:29:18.478
on other topics that are not really connected to our main research areas it happened in workshop

3:29:18.478,3:29:29.120
it happened in meeting well you know quite well that we have a lot of administrative meetings

3:29:29.120,3:29:38.719
and we try to make the best of them meaning that we have the opportunity to meet other

3:29:38.719,3:29:44.478
colleagues working in very different domains and what surprised me no doesn't surprise me but

3:29:44.478,3:29:53.680
what happened is that I see some kind of convergence in science as well meaning that

3:29:53.680,3:30:00.959
for example we have people trying to tackle numerical fluids problems and it just happens that

3:30:00.959,3:30:05.760
if you discuss with them during lunch you will see that they have

3:30:05.760,3:30:13.120
problems that are very similar to what problem you have and

3:30:13.120,3:30:19.760
you have developed algorithm for solving this problem they have developed their own algorithm

3:30:19.760,3:30:26.959
and it happens quite quickly frequently that well their tools may be quite useful

3:30:26.959,3:30:31.920
for us and reciprocally and in fact it's it's I will say it's just random

3:30:31.920,3:30:42.159
meeting so we just kiss with lawyers we discuss with biologists I have a biologist in my team

3:30:42.159,3:30:48.318
i will say just the open discussion

3:30:48.318,3:30:55.439
there is no systematic way to do it we have done a systematic approach at the beginning when we move

3:30:55.439,3:31:04.079
to industrial robotics to assistance robotics we spend two years making a lot of interviews with

3:31:04.079,3:31:12.079
customers help us medical community local authorities and really

3:31:12.079,3:31:17.920
it was very useful because we learned a lot of things we learned to avoid a lot of mistakes

3:31:17.920,3:31:23.760
which are very easy to make and I think that with artists it just happens that

3:31:23.760,3:31:31.359
it happens once a long time ago the world spread among the artists there is some team in

3:31:31.359,3:31:39.040
south of France which may help us to do whatever we want so this started accumulating and

3:31:39.040,3:31:49.439
the world spreads and that's it but there is no process for that in my opinion

3:31:49.439,3:32:02.719
thank you

3:32:02.719,3:32:12.238
sorry sorry so I was saying that in my first life at IRCAM when I was mostly working on

3:32:12.238,3:32:20.639
computer-assisted composition software tools we we had two kind of interactions between scientists

3:32:20.639,3:32:29.120
and artists in in the first situation the artist would come to the scientist with a problem

3:32:29.120,3:32:39.840
for instance a musical problem and would ask for help and expertise and algorithm and sometimes a

3:32:39.840,3:32:47.279
problem that was explained in a very lengthy way and seemed very complicated actually could

3:32:47.279,3:32:54.719
be solved with a very simple scientific or technological device or a simple algorithm

3:32:54.719,3:33:01.680
and sometimes a problem that seemed extremely simple to the artist and the artist thought that

3:33:01.680,3:33:05.359
he would really just need a little help to to achieve it

3:33:05.359,3:33:14.719
would actually become a huge scientific problem and maybe sometimes an unsolvable one

3:33:14.719,3:33:21.840
and this is very very interesting because it shows that the perception of complexity is very

3:33:21.840,3:33:29.520
different between artists and scientists scientists have issues of computability

3:33:29.520,3:33:37.840
which is a very difficult topic as as as you know and things that that are very obvious

3:33:37.840,3:33:46.478
in real life can become extremely difficult to model actually in in uh

3:33:46.478,3:33:54.159
a quantitative approach and sometimes the artists have a hard time understanding this because what

3:33:54.159,3:34:00.639
is simple for them and or complex and complicated for them it's totally different from what the

3:34:00.639,3:34:06.879
scientists would tackle as simple or complex so so we had this strange relationship in the

3:34:06.879,3:34:13.120
first place with the in the situation where the artist would come to the to the to the scientists

3:34:13.120,3:34:21.520
and asked so to speak for a service we had another kind of interaction which which went the other

3:34:21.520,3:34:27.439
way around so the scientists are also creative and creators except that they create scientific

3:34:27.439,3:34:34.799
theories or algorithms or models and they would come up with ideas of new models new algorithm

3:34:34.799,3:34:41.200
new fields and then they would talk about it because of course we have a lot of places to

3:34:41.200,3:34:48.238
talk workshops conferences seminars etc and then the artist would would come to the scientists and

3:34:48.238,3:34:54.318
say oh I never thought about that it's absolutely fascinating and it gives me an id for a new work

3:34:54.318,3:35:03.279
for a new piece maybe we can collaborate and so in this situation it it it would be it

3:35:03.279,3:35:09.359
would be the ideas coming from the scientist who would inform and influence the artist so that was

3:35:09.359,3:35:17.120
a traditional divide that was a traditional dichotomy between art and science as

3:35:17.120,3:35:25.520
a as a service-based relationship or art and science as a transfer or influence or transfer

3:35:25.520,3:35:30.959
of ids from one field to another it's two very different approaches and of course we we had

3:35:30.959,3:35:38.719
to cope with both but since I've been working on interactive and creative AI that is designing uh

3:35:38.719,3:35:44.398
kind of artificial create creatures that can live by themselves and interact on stage with musicians

3:35:44.398,3:35:51.520
now we're on in a very different situation because the the the concern now of the musician is how can

3:35:51.520,3:35:59.200
how can I have this artificial creature shut up for a moment because which is which is exactly

3:35:59.200,3:36:03.200
a question of control because we don't know really how to control them for instance we have

3:36:03.200,3:36:10.238
algorithm, AI algorithm, that generate music and do real-time machine learning in live situations etc

3:36:10.238,3:36:17.279
and they play music sometimes in a very smart way but they they they don't we see we still don't

3:36:17.279,3:36:27.680
have the cognitive model of intentionality and intrinsic motivation and all this that that makes

3:36:27.680,3:36:34.639
that that that can help us to decide when to start and when to stop doing something so generally

3:36:34.639,3:36:39.359
generally the the human who starts the computer and then the computer plays music it doesn't know

3:36:39.359,3:36:46.238
when to stop so so the the the human would would really like to have some more control over that

3:36:46.238,3:36:55.279
and so we so we are now moving to to to a paradigm of control and how to understand uh

3:36:55.279,3:37:05.200
control in the in the case where you have kind of artificial agents that that have a

3:37:05.200,3:37:13.439
that have a certain autonomy so the problem has totally shifted to to to this new issue of control

3:37:13.439,3:37:17.760
i think just what that

3:37:17.760,3:37:24.398
just one thing that I have to mention is that there is a parallel between in our collaboration

3:37:24.398,3:37:31.920
with that with a collaboration we have with doctors you have to be quite careful when you

3:37:31.920,3:37:39.040
do that for example if you go when you meet a doctor for the first time and tell him look you

3:37:39.040,3:37:46.478
have currently a medical process and I will teach you how to change it and to do it very efficiently

3:37:46.478,3:37:55.359
so you want to change everything then you are dead you have to learn to be incremental meaning

3:37:55.359,3:38:03.359
you have to simply state okay you have a process I will not change it I will just

3:38:03.359,3:38:11.600
help you on a given detail of this process to do it in a better way or to do it for you something

3:38:11.600,3:38:19.600
that you have currently doing we will avoid trying to do an example when you do a walking analysis

3:38:19.600,3:38:26.879
of a patient there is a classical test where you measure the time the guy takes to make 10 meter in

3:38:26.879,3:38:34.238
this straight line so so the surgeon is looking as at the chronometer

3:38:34.238,3:38:42.079
of looking at the way the guy is walking so the first thing we do is okay we will avoid you

3:38:42.079,3:38:46.159
looking at the chronometer because our machine will measure all the time for you

3:38:46.159,3:38:56.079
that's it they say okay because it was no big change for them and then we say well we can

3:38:56.079,3:39:00.398
measure also some of the things for example we have measured during this experiment this

3:39:00.398,3:39:09.040
particularity oh they say oh you can measure that so incrementally we add things we were able

3:39:09.040,3:39:18.238
to do since the very start of the program but we won't we don't want to say that at the beginning

3:39:18.238,3:39:27.760
and the doctors learned like the artists and when the request or the suggestion does not come from

3:39:27.760,3:39:37.120
us but from the doctors you have measured that but be possible to measure also that that we know we

3:39:37.120,3:39:44.318
have win and it's exactly the same process with artists in our first collaboration we were just

3:39:44.318,3:39:52.559
attacking with a small minor detail in the artwork showing it can be done and progressively

3:39:52.559,3:39:58.238
that you say oh you have been able to do that I would like to do another thing can you do it for

3:39:58.238,3:40:08.238
me and that's okay if you are these steps then you know that the collaboration will be quite fruitful

3:40:08.238,3:40:11.840
you have to be perfect

3:40:11.840,3:40:16.959
to fight your to fight your own mind we say okay we have this problem I know how

3:40:16.959,3:40:30.879
to deal with it completely and efficiently you have to learn that to be careful not do that

3:40:30.879,3:40:36.159
yes it is very smart approach and as you say the relation between artists

3:40:36.159,3:40:45.279
and scientists is a very delicate one and one has to treat it in a very delicate

3:40:45.279,3:40:48.879
yeah way you very much for

3:40:48.879,3:41:09.120
the cube okay and I think I we are almost running out of time for discussion so uh

3:41:09.120,3:41:40.799
no

3:41:40.799,3:41:48.318
okay okay I'd like to conclude this q a discussion session

3:41:48.318,3:41:56.159
and also this workshop so thank you very much for all participants

3:41:56.159,3:42:07.040
in this workshop you know for food for a discussion in this time so

3:42:07.040,3:42:17.359
can I across or who is a speaker for closing remarks yes I think you can you can conclude here

3:42:17.359,3:42:26.478
because I think Sebastian the chevalier *Jean Vivian* had to left earlier so you can conclude

3:42:26.478,3:42:33.520
okay I'd like to conclude this workshop and there was a wonderful presentation

3:42:33.520,3:42:40.559
so many wonderful presentations and there's so many issues to how to

3:42:40.559,3:42:47.520
deepen the relationship between art and advanced technology in this society

3:42:47.520,3:42:56.719
so I am very thankful to all the participants and for speakers and audience thank you very

3:42:56.719,3:43:12.879
much for making this workshop possible so I'd like to to end this workshop thank you very much

3:43:12.879,3:43:18.318
thanks a lot thank you thank you very much

3:43:18.318,3:43:27.199
thanks everyone thank you thanks take care bye bye thank you bye
